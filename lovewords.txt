the devil in th grove is an excellent historical account in which his impact is detailed  he fought so much injustice and  like too many  was met with hatred and lifethreatening violence  he had a huge and positive impact in the civil rights movement    ieutf8  qid1507985735  sr81  keywordsdevilinthegrove |  LOV

thank god for republicans like senator collins that have actual morals and values  |  LOV
yes  she s one of 7 remaining  |  LOV
they re rarer than hens  teeth nowadays  |  LOV
thank goodness please stay and inspire other colleagues to join you in actually looking out for your constituents  |  LOV
why not become a democrat susan  you seem much more in line with them than trump and his gang of cut throats  |  LOV
she saved the day for obama care and the 3 republicans are our heros but right now everyone hates the republicans like a passion they will over look the good thing those 3 did and vote demo maybe if she wants to be re elected 2020 she switches to a demo then we all can benifits of her saving the days in the future days |  LOV
one of the only sane gop members in congress  stay  |  LOV
both parties are still corrupt  however  if you belong to either  you re a traitor that must suck signed ind voters |  LOV
dear independent voters  the corrupt are in the minority  most democrats and republicans are good people  |  LOV
thank god  we need more sane voices like hers in congress  wouldlove to see her run for president  |  LOV
glad to hear there will be a centrist gopsenator around  we need more  |  LOV
thank you senator  we need you to help stop the crazy man in the white house |  LOV
i like her and republicans need more sanity in the senate because of the unstable president  |  LOV
bless this lady  she can do so much of worth as a senator   this coming from a democrat   |  LOV
thank you sen collins for your voice of reason  |  LOV
thank you susan collins  at least one sane senator  |  LOV
thank you senator collins  |  LOV
we need her to stop some of the worst the republicans want to do  |  LOV
she s the worst hypocrite ever  |  LOV
hope the voters in maine don’t fall for it just because she she voted against aca repeal twice  what good came out of that  the gop and white house continue to tear it apart  |  LOV
her ignorance on issues should scare everyone  |  LOV
i do nt live in maine  but i like her  she is gutsy  real  |  LOV
thank you for your support for the regular people of the united states    sticker   |  LOV
we need her in the senate  a voice of reason  |  LOV
good for the rest of us  |  LOV
susan collins is needed in the senate  |  LOV
it is good to know we have a few humans in politics😊 |  LOV
i like that she can help us all in the senate  we need her  |  LOV
20 years is enough no matter what party you vote for  |  LOV
at least some good news about republicans this week  |  LOV
the greed over people party  will turn her into a democrat before this is through  |  LOV
ray brown what does this statement refer to  |  LOV
lol  the friendly nazikkkrussian fetish party member  |  LOV
thank you senator collins we need you in the senate  |  LOV
i bet she s considering a run for president  |  LOV
that s not the collins who needs to go  ny needs to get rid of theirs  |  LOV
her vote of reason is needed on the senate  |  LOV
maine desperately needs a new governer but thank she is staying in the senate |  LOV
one of the few sane republicans |  LOV
love susan collins  she thinks for herself and her people  we need more  |  LOV
thank you because america needs you more than ever🇺🇸🇺🇸 |  LOV
my god  we need her sanity and honesty in washington  |  LOV
and they already have the greatest governor anyway  right  |  LOV
a woman who votes for the good of the country and it s citizens instead of her party  one of the few gop that can be respected  |  LOV
senator and  in your face  corruption go together  a fix and small number of senators by region  rich or poor  big or small  is the perfect recipe for corrupting democracy  |  LOV
at least a voice of reason will be around for a while longer  |  LOV
she is the breath of reason  |  LOV
we need your leadship now more than ever       |  LOV
thank you sen collins  |  LOV
wonderful  you are a great senator  thank you  |  LOV
after 2018  she will be just another one of the 60 republican senators plus the vp  that will give republicans in the senate  power of cloture  they are only 8 seats away now  there are 25 democratic held seats up for reelection  half of those are in trump won red states  republicans will more than likely pick up 810 seats  when that happens  senate democrats will be locked out of all discussion and votes  where they will lose every time  because they will have 40 seats or less  that makes susan collins positions in the senate almost meaningless  trump will get 3 more sc nominations before 2020 democrats will not be able to stop a single one  that will tilt the court 81 right  for the next 2530 years  |  LOV
and that will mark the end of the constitution and democracy and this country permanently |  LOV
yay that s where we need her  |  LOV
thank you  susan  we need you there  |  LOV

wonderful idea  feel everyone  no matter where you live or status in current situation  should learn how to swim  actually it would be best for parents to consider this a priority for all of their children  live in a city where many  if not most  residents have a pool or easy access to one at any time  unfortunately  as soon as the weather starts warming up each year  the news reports of child drownings begin  incidents in most cases could be prevented  |  LOV

westerners seem to care so much about the plight of this one lady while ignoring the plights of millions of women and children who perished in libya  syria  yemen  afghanistan  iraq under intense western bombardments  the reason is that this lady is just playing a character  all of it is scripted to serve the geopolitical propaganda  taliban and western oligarchs are partners in crimes  |  LOV
notice that god is beginning to punish the westerners  |  LOV
many are concerned about the west s involvement in endless and unending foreign wars  it is difficult to get our politcians to give straight answers about this problem  trump campaigned saying he would end the usa s involvement in these wars  and now he is sending more troops to afghanistan   |  LOV
mh  be angry  |  LOV
your pints are valid  particularly about oligarchs  we have one here  but let s give her a chance to see who and what she becomes  because she is perceived as a crusader  people look up to her  let us watch and see  |  LOV
the war in afghanistan has nothing to do with  freedom  or fighting terrorism  that s how the war industry feeds itself by funding and arming the fictitious enemy they re allegedly fighting  look how our  heroes  are guarding the opium fields  they are not heroes actually  they are there to serve the rich in exchange of some benefits for themselves  the war industry as well as the veterans are liabilities on ordinary taxpayers       |  LOV
understood  it s a bigger problem than one child can represent  but we should see what she can do since she has the attention of much of the world now  if she is a puppet  it will shoe |  LOV
the best  strongest  bravest  truly a shinning light for her country and all who suffer political oppression  ca nt wait to see what you do next |  LOV
