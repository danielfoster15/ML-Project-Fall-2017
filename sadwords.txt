too bad this happens  hopefully  the son has not lost any money in this matter  with only time and pride being dinged  he should consider it a lesson learned  however  i would add to nick s response that the reader not act on behalf of their son without the son s knowledge or authorization  preferably  if the son wishes to seek legal counsel or complain to authorities  he should do it himself  |  SAD
the biggest red flag here  since all the little red flags of this being set up as a sales meeting were missed was  they would not tell you the benefits  until after you were hired  that s as vital to you to make the decision  as your qualifications and experience would be for them  to make theirs  back to my other comment  a job interview is as much about you interviewing them  as them  interviewing you  that should have been treated by the son  just as an employer would have treated a prospect  that refused to say where he worked last and what his education is  |  SAD
i say this again and again as this attitude fixes a lot of problems  a job interview is just as much about you interviewing them  as them interviewing you   more  by some considerations  as for whom you work makes a huge difference in your life  but to them you re just one prospective employee  do nt be sold  do nt feel obligated to follow through on tricky interview scenarios  do nt let them make you feel like you re begging at your door to be let in like you re there to see the wizard of oz or something  |  SAD
as someone who was hr for a legit company that did seasonal hiring  we did do group interviews for the first round  we wanted to see how the applicants worked as a team  what their social skills were like  and the final interview was a one on one  so do nt freak out if a first interview is in a group setting  |  SAD
i think the real issue is how hr has replaced personnel  we used to be people to companies  now we are just resources to them  like equipment  |  SAD
it s fairly common to have group interviews in the social services field  i agree with everything else  |  SAD
trump‚Äôs america  why is anyone surprised  |  SAD

bobby myers is always an extra laugh when a trump supporter calls ‚Äúidiots‚Äù |  SAD
people get murdered every single day in this country  this one just happens to make great left wing propaganda so they throw it at the wall to see if it sticks  it s sad but no more than all the rest  |  SAD

a very incorrect headline  the best practices would focus on rehabilitation instead of incarceration  the  war on drugs  will never be won by law enforcement  |  SAD
i think that is what nm has been doing  working on the psychological side of the situation  unfortunately  the law part of the equation rounds up people via the drugs or addiction outcomes  yep  the waging war on drugs seemed like a logical thing to do at the time  but it based its strength on people being able to handle themselves  trauma changes that equation  |  SAD
probably because instead of creating opioid regulations  focusing on mental illness  and addiction itself should be primary  i dare say that most people whom end up mentally addicted to opioids  have probably already experienced some form or forms of addiction  |  SAD
colorado saw a decline in opiate related deaths after it legalized cannabis  when it‚Äôs easier to get addictive lethal drugs from your doctor than it is a very nonlethal drug like weed  you get more death  the rest of the county could learn from that    tidsmfb  utmterm17252b7358ff |  SAD
prohibition doesn‚Äôt work  that‚Äôs why  the harder you crack down  the more you reduce supply  the higher prices become  the more lucrative the black market becomes  the harder they push drugs  the more they cut the drugs with more dangerous cheap fillers  we need a regulated market  where potency  purity  and price is a constant  and the only prohibited things are public intoxication  and advertisement  where we pity addicts  supply users with usage guidelines to avoid addiction  and provide assistance to those who have problems  and stop taking medication away from those who need it  |  SAD
i liked the segment on mon night  i lived a short time in the rio arriba area of new mex  very beautiful area that georgia okeefe made famous  recognized a clinic near el rito where i lived  even back 20 years ago there was a big drug problem localized in espanola  and gangs  but really hope they get help  i spent time in mexico too  they started raising poppies in the last 20 years  and producing heroin  |  SAD
this area of nm is permeated with drug abuse and crime and has been for the 2 decades i have lived in the state  people avoid the area entirely  now albuquerque is the car theft capital of the us  what do you bet illegal drug use is associated with that as well  |  SAD
it is not an opioid problem  it is a greed problem  the greed of drug companies  the greed of drug distributors  and the greed of congress who undermine drug laws and prosecutions  |  SAD
unlike other disasters  the opioid crisis wo nt burn itself out  new addicts are created every day  what if there is no solution  my friend ever the pragmatist says we should save out money and let these people die  i disagree but i have no answers to the problem  |  SAD
i really don  t have the answer either  |  SAD
we could make it legal  saving most of the lives  we could let the taliban stop the production again    we could stop the corporations from distributing it  |  SAD
physicians write the scripts  and people willing take the pills |  SAD
since america invaded afghanistan the opium trade has exploded with it being said 1 trillion dollars has been made so far with 92  of the opiate products reaching the streets of america nobody that started this wants us to end it  |  SAD

michael simpson sorry man  while i agree  no over doses and clam happy people ca nt be a negative  you are misinformed on what addiction is  |  SAD
those look like bales of pot  could it be that they re concentrating on pot for the headlines and ignoring opioids  |  SAD

pbs newshour there is a huge side of this story that is not being covered  due to this opioid crisis  patients in hospitals with acute  not chronic  pain are not getting the pain management they need  i have a chronic condition that required major pelvic and abdominal surgery 6 weeks ago and was weaned off narcotics within 48 hours and sent home with nothing more than tylenol and ibuprofen  which damages my stomach   i ve never had issues with opioid addiction and have been prescribed narcotics in the past after surgery  but now i find myself without an important tool in my postop recovery  thankfully  the worst is behind me but i would nt wish the pain from those first couple weeks on anybody  going through support groups and anecdotes online  this story is becoming very common  could you please look into it  thanks  keep up the great work  |  SAD

people always use the name of religion to do the inhumane things  what s an ironically world we live in   once religion is mixed up with politic  tragedy will fall upon the people of that society and the around the world  i wonder when we  as the human species  learn from our past failure mistakes  |  SAD

many arakan  rakhine  homes were destroyed by bengali  socalled rohingya  terrorists and extremist bengali  socalled rohingya  villagers  there might have some bengali homes that were destroyed by fire due to the arsabengali terrorists and burmese army battles  but there are many homes that were set on fire by bengali themselves and arsa bengali terrorists  it is because they want to get the humanitarian support from international communities such as un  oic  etc  and they want to give the bad image to rakhine  arakanese  and myanmar government  and want to get sympathy and support from international communities especially from islamic countries  remark   the socalled rohingya is bengali  |  SAD
propaganda  |  SAD
your perspective and analysis are very  very important your perspective and analysis are very much important to resolve the conflict and restore peace and stability in arakanrakhine  myanmar  analysis is very important to give your right perspectives and suggestion  real information is vital  bengali  socalled rohingya  terrorist who lost in military attack try to get political benefit and to misunderstand myanmar among the international communities  so  bengali terrorists are taking a wave of propaganda operation in bengali muslim communities in order to bengali muslims get fear and flee from their villages for safety  bengali people flee for bangladesh due to propaganda which says  ‚Äúyou will be killed when burmese soldier come‚Äù this word is spreading all the time in muslims communities and makes them fear  empty villages are set fire everyday by bengali terrorist after bengali people ran away for their safety  then took video burning homes and villages  and they upload burning houses and villages videos in different social websites such as facebook  twitter and so on by mentioning burmese troops and local rakhine people set villages fire  bengali terrorists are lying the world  some media also supporting the terrorist so that media doesn‚Äôt give the right information to the international communities  resulting of this bias and propaganda  rakhine people and myanmar have been seen extremist  aggressive people by the world  imagine that how rakhine people could set villages fire while they are fleeing away for their safety  very few people sheltering in maung daw and buthidaung townships but villages in rural are empty  how they can set villages fire  so  i would like to suggest the international communities  please try to know the real ground situation in rakhine for your perspective and judgement  your perspective and judgement are very much important to resolve the conflict  thank you very much for your time  |  SAD

46  way to go firefighters  thank you  lets get to 100  soon  and next week s rain may put it out  |  SAD
45  contained is a massive improvement  i still do nt understand why  when this kind of event occurs annually at this time of year  the are not sophisticated preventative measures in place  understood that wind will be a factor  not understood why in august we send in the troops to do everything to prevent this destruction  noted that grasses were cut  we were there last weekend and into monday   but were power lines checked  zero percent containment seemed to go on too long  welcome insights and education on this  |  SAD
most of it could have been prevented with stricter building codes and brush removal with goats in the spring and summer  also removal of dead trees  but they all wanted someone else to pay for it  |  SAD
most of that is heavily enforced already  i know as a resident of sonoma county  |  SAD
i can not believe the state of california  being one of america s top gdp earners and providers to the federal government  ca nt find a solution to control the wild fires taking place  how can a place meant for the greatest vacation  be a death plot for mother nature  i do not plan to visit nor live in that state  it is not safe for other people  it is not safe for me  great economy  by the way  sad  to hear about the families lost in the fire with late news and little to no advisement of what to do  terrible to hear  |  SAD

it s fake news that our president is nt helping pr  geraldo rivera has family that lives there  even his mother he went there  he reported that the country is getting everything possible  he said he was proud of the job president trump had done to help them out  pr had lots of problems before the hurricanes deep debt  no power on parts of it  just general lack of upkeep   so many of the issues were already there  now it s just worse  i think they are trying to manipulate the story to get everyone to hate the president   |  SAD
monica crist no one had to manipulate a story on pr to get people to hate trump  |  SAD
monica crist  trump is simply an incompetent president  and an embarrassment to this great nation  he has managed to divide our people in the usa  and made us the laughing stock of the world  you are obviously a very brainwashed individual and i feel sorry for you  please stop butting in to defend that buffoon  if i were you  i d be embarrassed to talk   furthermore  you do nt have to lecture me about what the problems of puerto rico are  and  you might need to learn a little more about history before you even try to talk to this well educated puertorican about the situation on my island  geraldo rivera is an embarrassment to most puertoricans  whether he has family there or not  you have no clue what you are saying  you really  really do nt  geraldo is a joke not a journalist  for decades now he stands in front of a camera to spout opinion and not facts  and people wearing horse blinders  who do nt fact check  watch or listen to other news sources and eat up anything they are fed by fox news  and other equally moronic news  venues  like brightbart and rush linbaugh  just believe him  i watched his reports  from the island and it was laughable  except i was frikin  crying my eyes out  if you need any information on where to go to read and learn about the real history of the colony of puerto rico i will be more than happy to provide it  feel free to ask me and i will get it to you  |  SAD
monica crist  here is a little summary  history lesson   when united states navy warship ‚Äúgloucester‚Äù pulled into gu√°nica bay in the early morning hours of july 25  1898  puerto rico became our responsibility  when the disembarking sailors lowered the spanish flag from the port flagpole and hoisted the american flag  puerto rico became our responsibility  when the puerto rican house of delegates voted unanimously in 1914 to be free of us rule and the us congress refused to recognize their independence  puerto rico was our responsibility  when the us congress passed the jonesshafroth act on march 2  1917 declaring all puerto ricans born after april 10  1899 to be fullfledged us citizens  puerto rico was our responsibility  did you catch that  in 1917  the year the law was passed  people born in 1899 would be turning 18 ‚Äì legal draft age  the law was passed on march 2  1917 the us entered wwi on april 6  1917 when we gave this grant of citizenship in 1917 over the unanimous objection of all representatives in the puerto rican house of delegates who believed the grant of citizenship was primarily for the purpose of drafting puerto rican men into military service  puerto rico was our responsibility  when section 1402 of title 8 of the us code was amended in 1952 to declare that all puerto ricans born after january 13  1941 are natural born american citizens  puerto rico was our responsibility  when the republican congress passed ‚Äì and bill clinton signed ‚Äì legislation in 1996 beginning a tenyear phaseout of fdr new deal tax incentives for us corporations to create taxfree earnings through subsidiaries operating in puerto rico  the failure of the economy of puerto rico became our responsibility  when the consequent tenyear mass exodus of us companies and jobs was complete in 2005 and the economy of puerto rico began contracting  the financial plight of puerto rico became our responsibility  when the us congress made all interest on municipal bonds issued by puerto rico free of federal  state  and local taxes  causing wall street fund managers to pour loanedmoney into the puerto rican government like water pouring over the broken levees of lake pontchartrain  the debt of puerto rico became our responsibility  this is history  |  SAD
while exploring ways to help  i am praying for all impacted by these disasters  california  puerto rico  usvirgin islands  florida  louisiana  texas  may your recovery be quick and complete  |  SAD
punishment from god long over due and the worst is yet to come  the state of california is one of the most evil in the nation  with its selfrighteous hypocritical people  its crime and corruption  its racist suburbia  its rampant abortion culture  its sexual perversions  its sanctimonious silicone valley with their traitorous nature  its fornications and adulteries  its police brutality  its government extortion  its hollywood culture  its lawless immigrant culture  etc  etc  etc  the state has many many flaws  and they are unrepentant  and they are being punished  |  SAD
remember  god do nt like no ugly  especially someone like you using his name for your own hatred  |  SAD
radford  you re an idiot  |  SAD
so much for free will  |  SAD
yeah  the evil spirit behind you peoples personal insults is a great example of why god is punishing this nation  the whole country is infested with disrespectful  undisciplined people like urself what do not know god  nor do you care about his laws and statutes  you have made urselves god  and have made ur own rules  and this is the era of account  so keep on yappin so that evil angel will know where to find u  |  SAD
you‚Äôre bat crap crazy dude and just ridiculously stupid  go crawl back under a rock from whence you came   |  SAD
and the fact that all youre capable of making is a simple minded insult is indicative of the fact that that rock is actually your home  you people literally think that insulting people and trynna shame them just because u dont like their opinion is the way to act  dont you  all you are guaranteeing is that the kinds of evil you see happening accross the nation lately will most certainly be coming to you as well  and frankly  good riddance  |  SAD
radford johnson i moved back here six years ago even tho at church in the communion line  the holy spirit said in my heart   do nt go   i suffered a great chastisement because of my disobedience  all i do now since i may not get a  word   is to try my best to witness to anyone god puts in my path  i agree that this area is rift with sin and the energy is bad here  they think that if they break a law  and do nt get caught  they can smirk and that they  got over  on somebody  there is no common decency here  there is arrogance and entitlement  now i am not to judge  the bible tells me that  there are good people mixed in  but even they are tainted by this evil culture  i do believe the righteous will be spared  that what the unrighteous have stored up will be given to the righteous and that god is to be feared  we are in the end  so please anyone reading this   know that the bible is the inspired word of god  pray that you may find the truth and go to heaven  by the saving grace and blood of our lord jesus christ  sincerely  |  SAD

god  does nt have anything to do wthis moron  |  SAD
yeah  and while you people are in denial  there is an increase in calamity in this nation and over the next few years it will increase exponentially  with each blasphemous post you justify the increase in calamity  and even when fires  floods  terrorism  hurricanes  mass killings  governmental abuses began to become more and more common  even effecting each and every one that has replied to my comment  you still will not repent  and you will blaspheme  cuz the average human being would rather die than obey god  and i say good riddance  |  SAD
radford johnson the increase in calamity is due to global warming  moron  there are some very good articles online explaining how that happens if you would pull your head out and read  |  SAD
fool  what is behind global warming    is it not the greed  incompetance and negligence of mankind  are not such self destructive behaviors influenced by evil forces unseen by animals  especially the talking variety    |  SAD
you think you are better than me because of your knowledge  dont you  well  better people than you are suffering in those fires  and i hope you too will be suffering the wrath of god  |  SAD
off your meds  you are  |  SAD
people who are only capable of personal insults lack intelligence  people who post replies and then hide them from me so i cant clap back are cowards  |  SAD
god does nt exist |  SAD
you re the one being laughed at here  bro  now take your pills and go back to sleep  |  SAD
yeah  hyenas can laugh  what is ur point  oh thas right  u dont have one cuz u lack the intelligence  you honestly believe that laughing at someone that u disagree with has merit  dont u  youre a fool  u think laughing is going to prevent the next natural disaster  u think laughing will prevent the next mass shooting or other kind of terrorist attack  people like you are simple minded  you have no solutions  you can not take a stand  cuz you are too busy thinking of ways to humiliate people what are critical of society when u are too cowardly to cuz ur afraid of being laughed at lol  |  SAD
guerrerro  if u can not understand the invisible forces that would cause a man to kill 58 and wound 400 then it is because you reason like an animal  and just as sure as there are invisible forces of evil what cause mankind to act against his own best interests  there are also invisible forces of good what give man freedom to choose which force to submit to  |  SAD

ca vegetation as chaparral  cedar oak cypress can blossom n flourish with seasonally abundant rainfall quickly but the minimal moisture they retain during the dry periods can evaporate as quickly making them a virtual tinder box  why i believe prevention measures as prescribed back burning is so critical with sufficient fire mitigation resources  |  SAD
they are amazing dealing with this horrible fire  i hope they will able to put it out soon  |  SAD
crying shame  |  SAD
cal fire is only now investigating and it will take weeks to find the truth  i find it very irresponsible of any news organization to put out this speculation  kqed shame  |  SAD
kqed was reporting a newspaper story on the fire‚Äôs cause and on calls to police  it‚Äôs called responsible journalism  |  SAD
whatever the cause  s   this is a tragedy  with lives and homes and livelihoods and natural surroundings lost  has anyone heard from the monster in the white house  |  SAD
someone should have thought to turn off the power  when high winds were causing a fire storm here many years ago  the idaho electric company had the smarts to turn off the power  and that kept the fires to a minimum that did little damage  the spokane company kept the power on  and many homes were lost because fire made a ring all around the city  |  SAD
you are so right  also it is about time all power lines were buried in the ground  oh  that costs too much money say the utility companies  of course  if you home burns down you and your insurance have to pay for the rebuilding  not the utility company  ha  ha  |  SAD
in addition to smelling fire  i smell lawsuits  this is like holding mandalay bay responsible for the las vegas shooter  fire is a fact of california  fire prevention is important  but not always possible  |  SAD
my heart goes out to the people of sonoma county  i visited on a bike tour and loved the scenery and the genuine  friendly people  |  SAD
well after the october 2007 witch creek fires üî• sdg  e was found liable for failure to maintain and inspect their power lines  it s plausible |  SAD
and raise rates to pay off their lawsuits  disgusting  |  SAD
then pg  e should be investigated  why these powerphone lines are still above ground in the 21st century is disturbing  money and greed for more money  |  SAD
down power lines caused yet snother mega fire here in nm  the los conchas fire  i have no doubt that some of these fires were started this way  |  SAD
their own memo s showing cut backs in tree trimming work around their power lines all across california  |  SAD
pg  e cut their budget for tree maintenance  pge has the task of the cutting all branches on private and public property which touch  or are close to the transformers installed on high telephone poles throughout ca the result of pg  e saving money over the years by removing safety maintence of all their underground and above ground connections  caused the huge loss of homes and lives in san bruno when the pg  e gas exploded from underground  now they are responsible for trees sparking fires in the winds to kill 31 people and destroy hundreds of homes  businesses and ranches  the only other city which still had same old underground gas lines were left in capitola ca two years ago pg  e had to get their crews into that city to remove all the old lines  the crew had stored filled gas tanks on a small open field in the center of capitola  across from a bank and a well known bakery  at a busy intersection  i told the owners of the businesses and the bank manager that those many long tankers were an explosion waiting to happen  they reported them to the city  which was down the street  to make them move them asap  |  SAD
there were 34 fires how the hell could that all be one thing  |  SAD
it s interesting that trees on private land must be cut by pg  e  it s too bad people were nt proactive in protecting their own areas by trimming their own trees  or better yet finding other areas to plant trees  social responsibility |  SAD
the 2007 witch fire in san diego county was started by sdge not mantaining brush  now they are trying to raise rates to pay for all their lawsuits  nothing to see here  |  SAD

ann lane this is sarcasm  right  |  SAD
well that was awkward  caught her lying grant great job  |  SAD
so it is ok to wring our hands and cry  think of the children  when the issue of bathrooms comes up but not when raising awareness of homeless children  am i reading you correctly  |  SAD
alisa arthur lol  that is just too ridiculous  lol |  SAD
grant colley an agenda is an agenda  the only difference is if you choose a side to promote rather than taking every social issue seriously  i m happy that you can be unaware of issues that plague other segments of society  not sure why you would complain about strangers caring about others but that could be a whole other thread  |  SAD
michael blair typical liberal stupid response  |  SAD
alisa arthur pbs constantly uses children to form its followers emotions  very manipulative and harmful  |  SAD
grant colley you should be emotional when learning about homeless children  you should get emotional  then look at the amount of children who are homeless and do something to help them  i volunteer in a shelter for children and their families  drawing attention to them is needed  families with children are the fastest growing sect of homeless in america right now  btw  hotels and shelters count as home visits  |  SAD
michael langdon pbs constantly uses children to manipulate its followers  emotions  very wrong  |  SAD
alison mccarrel miller pbs constantly uses children to manipulate its followers  emotions  very wrong  besides  its a movie  there are tremendous resources currently available for homeless children  every resource is available to them  food  shelter  money  social help  what is drawing attention to children and families in shelters going to do  what do you want us to do that is not being done  if they are in hotels and shelters they are not on the streets homeless  |  SAD
how is pbs using children to manipulate  please explain that statement further  |  SAD
grant colley every resources is available  where do you get that information  federal funding is not enough  and proposed cuts will lessen what is available  most shelters operate on private donations and volunteering  do you donate  do you volunteer  what exactly do you do or know about the homeless children in america  do you know that some spend only part time in hotels  the rest in their cars  do you know that many couch surf never having an actual bed or bedroom  do you know that in any given night  25 million children sleep on the streets of our country  do you know that most have nt a clue how or why we have children living on the streets  this might be a movie  but if it helps raise awareness then it s a good thing  tremendous resources my a    you know nothing  |  SAD
crystal moran pbs posts pictures of children to appeal to people s humanity and guilt  this is done to sway people to their political ideology  it is done constantly and shamelessly  |  SAD
alison mccarrel miller there is federal funding  state funding  local funding  charities  i worked in the family court system  to say that there are not programs and resources for homeless kids  is beyond disingenuous  it s a lie  you do yourself  and everyone else  if you were better informed  or  not be a emotionally driven liar  |  SAD
grant colley i am neither a liar  nor am i disingenuous  i did not say there were none  there are resources  but there are not tremendous resources  they are quite limited  and they are  pending  major cuts and many have guidelines that disqualify a huge amount of those in need  i have been working in a homeless shelter for the last 5 years  including doing the books  look into how many shelters of any kind keep the family together as a unit  allows a father with daughters keep his girls with him during crisis  how many women with boys over age 12 are allowed in the women s shelters  yes there are some resources  some funding but no where near what is needed and most is private donations  as an example from one chapter  of over  777k only  76k was provided by grants and not all of them were federal or state grants  again most were private from civics groups etc  the need is great the funding is minimal and if a film raises awareness from one additional person to either donate or volunteer  it is worth it  all of this information is available online  990 s are available  point in time counts are available  federal and state budgets  designations  and proposed cuts are all available  i wo nt comment on the family court system  sspeaking from the shelter side  there is no where near enough help  let alone tremendous   |  SAD

meridian mckenzie it matters if you are homeless  this is about pbs using children  not me  my money helps  start making sense  |  SAD
in some states  you are legally considered homeless if your house has a cracked window   although you probably already know that   frankly  this movie was written and produced by people who s affiliation with pbs is the interview in the video and maybe some arts grant or something  as far as i can tell pbs just serves as the messenger here  but my question is  what specifically do you consider pbs s political ideology to be  and this me guessing at your opinion on that ideology  but why do you think pbs s ideology is harmful  |  SAD

agreed  i m always wondering why this so called cleansing of an ethnic muslim minority draws so much attention when the general ongoing persecution of muslims elsewhere on the planet never causes a whimper  |  SAD

your comment reminds me of trump s statement of good guys being on both sides after charlottesville  just in reverse  |  SAD
ethic cleansing is a one sided and simple solution |  SAD
sam and jeffrey  if the rohingya‚Äôs were a peaceable people  i‚Äôd see your point  s   but historically  they are not   the burmese tend to view them as squatters  without land ownership rights and causing violence and mayhem wherever they settle   i do not condone violence on either side but with knowledge  i do understand where it originated from  my point was that this issue is not so simplistic as to claim ‚Äúpoor rohingyas‚Äù when there are thousands of buddhist burmese families that have been victimized by the squatters  i‚Äôm not in agreement with the violence perpetrated by either side  i‚Äôd like to see a peaceable agreement reached by the burmese government and military with the rohingya in rakhine state  there is always two sides to the story  |  SAD

may be more should be done to protect against these fires  homes should not be surrounded by large amounts of trees and bushes  but should cut them down and replace with gravel or paved areas  the japanese type gardens would provide more protection  metal roofs would be less flammable  when a forest fire starts why do nt they immediately send in b52s to drop water on the area before the fire gets out of control  i have always wondered that  |  SAD

scott is right  the current generation of opium based drugs were promoted by pharmaceutical companies as non addictive  they were nt  and yes  they were freely prescribed for pain as they were believed to be  safe   of course there was plenty of money to be made too  |  SAD
they will never blame big pharma they donate too much money to everyone  |  SAD

this is just the conversation i was having with my canadian friends from vancouver  and mercy  canadians must be soulless too  cause vancouver has a terrible  terrible drug problem for years   fentanyl is the wildcard on this drug crisis  i will watch this  |  SAD
did the pharmaceuticals really come up with fentanyl to help cancer victims or addict a nation  |  SAD
i m very concerned that people are being one sided about this drug  i know many first responders who have said this drug saves lives to a large degree also  it is a vital tool  abused it s deadly  but i find this campaign alarming  for terminal patients and for victims of shock it s vital  many crash survivors  burn victims  gun shot victims and many others only survived because of the strength of this drug  the addiction overdose stats are truly alarming but they have not published the statistics that are life saving and essential medicine for terminal patients  it concerns me to see vital medicine demonized because of misuse  if it is banned many more will die unnecessarily from trauma  many terminal patients will take their lives prematurely as the pain can be unbearable  |  SAD

addiction isn‚Äôt caused by the substances addicts use  it‚Äôs the manifestation of the symptoms of the disease of addiction  fentanyl that is killing people isn‚Äôt from the pharmacy it‚Äôs manufactured in china and mexico and distributed by the cartels  don‚Äôt condemn those in chronic pain and cancer patients in immeasurable pain to agony for what has nothing to do with them  addicts use substances because their disease process  the substance doesn‚Äôt create the addict  |  SAD
if you read up on it a bit you will find that these pharmaceutical companies who may manufacture the drugs elsewhere actually put forth a huge campaign telling doctors that these opioids were not as addictive as we know they are  thereby giving doctors an open door to prescribe at will  as so many folks became dependent on them the price went up and word got out just what was happening  then they cracked down on giving already addicted people the drug they were dependent on sending them to street drugs  |  SAD
why do nt you talk about all the people in chronic pain getting screwed over because of opophobia  i had my face ripped open by a 140lb rottweiler needed 4 stitches and you know what they did for my pain  nothing    they said take an advil  it s like pain has been criminalized  the two groups of people in this country it s ok to make fun of the obese and people in chronic pain  |  SAD

medical community is only partially responsible  over the last 8 years under obama  a drug problem became a drug epidemic  open borders allowed drugs to flow freely into this country and the cartels established their billion dollar business in the u s no attempt was made by obama‚Äôs drug czar to establish anti drug education  our schools are the cartels future market  what are we doing about it  |  SAD
the rapid increase in opiod usage is one of grave concern  after the vietnam war  soldiers came back addicted and found it difficult to reacclimate into the mainstream  their experiennces were so terrible so toxic  that drugs were taken to soften their realities  however  what i do nt understand right now  is why there is this resurgence  why so many people are opting to drug out  to risk themselves  their lives  their children who are born already addicted  what is the trigger now    |  SAD

the opioid crises  which policymakers did nt care about until it started affecting white people  is in large part a result of our forprofit medical industry  pharma companies push docs to prescribe opioids  docs push prescriptions because they re in competition with other docs who do  and do nt want to be seen as not  caring  about their patients  pain   forprofit  recovery  centers cycle addicts in and out  over and over again  charging insurance companies for their  services   time for single payer  folks  |  SAD

have taken opioids since 2010 not daily but when i needed them  i have had a hip replacement and knee surgery  never once did i get high or steal to buy them from street dealers  when i want to be absolutely pain free for shopping or vacation  i will take them  i like to be mobile  i cant under stand how you get addicted  i have tried the hemp oil and think it works better |  SAD
anecdotal  but i knew somebody who became addicted after minor surgery  he was furious that the doc did nt warn him  i guess different chemistry than you  |  SAD
i used to smoke cigarettes but had no issue quitting  every chemical effects each individual differenly  and some peoples brains are predisposed to addiction  and being prescribed medication like flips on a switch in their brain  some overcome it  some dont  theres quite a bit of helpful information available to learn about the science behind addiction  you can google  scholarly artciles on addiction  to get gopd sources |  SAD
its all in the person  i liked opium but  didnt want get a habit so it is just an old memory now  never went back  maybe i liked myself too much |  SAD
peggy silcox the problem is differentiating physical dependence from addiction  anyone taking opioids regularly for an extended period of time will develop increased tolerance and physical dependence  but once off the drugs  most people don‚Äôt experience craving for them  addicts may or may not be physically dependent  but they are mentally and emotionally dependent on them  and merely taking the drugs away doesn‚Äôt address the emotional and mental dependence or the factors that brought that about  |  SAD
but  david  there are physical withdrawal symptoms if an addict attempts to quite cold turkey  heck  there are physical symptoms if a regular coffee drinker quits cold turkey  |  SAD
this is exactly why medical professionals have termed it as a ‚Äúdisease‚Äù  one that you vera should thank god you don‚Äôt have  it‚Äôs a difference in brain chemistrycomponents that contribute to a person developing the symptoms of addiction  which is often passed down hereditarily  like many other diseases   where you wereare able to stop  another person isn‚Äôt and they are not necessarily to blame for that  it‚Äôs taken quite some time and a considerable amount of research and data for doctors  scientists to arrive at this conclusion  since they have there has been remarkable progress in the treatment of addicts with great turn arounds  however  the issue remains due to the fact that the individual themselves have to arrive at the conclusion that they indeed have a problem and need to receive help for it  the current crisis our country is facing is reliant on this factor  people will try and argue it and say it isn‚Äôt a disease til they‚Äôre blue in the face  you‚Äôll find these individuals have also not received any further education past high school  not to say they are dumb but they just don‚Äôt know any better and due to that they remain stagnant in their knowledge and cling to biases  personally  i‚Äôd never argue with a mechanic about what‚Äôs wrong with a car unless i were maybe a mechanic myself but not everyone is sensibly rational in that manner  which is tough to even witness  i‚Äôve heardread individuals who are bartenders  in car sales  a roofer  and landscapers try to discredit the findings of reputable doctorsscientists  men and women with phd‚Äôs in their field who have not only the knowledge but also experience   to me  that is the most absurd and ridiculous thing to have ever witnessed but there‚Äôs no convincing them otherwise  it‚Äôs stubborn ignorance in its highest form and i just wish people would allow themselves the opportunity of learning more about that which they hold such strong opinions of  |  SAD
most people who take these drugs do nt become addicted  that s why the drugs are still legal  if 2 to 5 percent of the population has a physiological difference that increases their tendency to become addicted  that s a lot of people in a population as large as ours is  it s a really big problem for everyone  |  SAD
also  a person does nt have to be an addict to use an opioid recreationally  many nonaddicts will still make use of a drug like this occasionally  that creates a higher demand on the streets and higher theft and abuse of such drugs  it increases the chance a person with a hereditary tendency to develop an addiction will end up trying the drug  |  SAD

wildfires occur naturally and have always been a part of the seasonal cycle in the west  but the size and intensity of the fires have dramatically increased in recent years due  in large measure  to the gross mismanagement of the national forests by the us forest service and the incessant lawsuits of radical environmentalists that have thwarted all reasonable attempts at proper forest management   lfacebookcomlphp   3a  2f   2ftech  2fenvironment  2fitem  2f16396burningupthewestfedsgreenscausecatastrophicfires  hatpe1xz9qbssxag3ffpemq7nb5kp6mzbgacsvs9hghqueoq9kalzwrpqthbutydtmc2zsasgifzihvgjecfuckg6zulpzhfst6p8pyxdt50fu9snulksmx0nxnxkmyjy5l9lp4ke34th0zmw9tb21jvuah6k037jejgtanupacnkstsxvfbtopojm6giaj5pvy3fbsypjhuvgvojbv5ooiuw6yzkfza3f1vybzluwpfomarvse2xragwik5znoj90zeuftit |  SAD

 white democrat privileged wealthy  you clearly do nt know the area very well then  contrary to conservative opinion not every part of ca is some liberal fantasy land  this is an area with a lot of hard working americans with a wide range of political opinions who work in the wine making industry  the hospitality and service industry  and dozens of others professions and jobs that make up the region  to say something like  too bad the whole state of california did nt burn up   is both crass and shamelessly ignorant  it would be like wishing the worst on those in huston and florida for their conservative politics  if you knew anything about fighting wildfires you d know ca routinely sends their crews to fight in other states and vice versa  ca got hit hard this year as have other states  have some basic compassion  the privileged and wealthy are a tiny demographic compared to the average americans suffering a horrific disaster  |  SAD

i used to live in sacramonto  this is unthinkable  |  SAD
i wonder if they are arson  so many at once  |  SAD
i speculated the notion  but i amounted it to my job in highend restaurant business and hatred for their vendors  |  SAD
my husband is a wildland firefighter for the forest service  he noted that there were no lighting storms and thought it was probably arson  it will be interesting to see what the investigations turn up  |  SAD
there have been very many wild fires along the west coast from canada on down  try thinking global warming and climate change  |  SAD
there was a terrible windstorm sunday night  very high winds  spreading burning embers  so sad that people spread hateful posts  when so many are losing their homes   some their lives  |  SAD
elizabeth dobson very possible  |  SAD
the fires and resulting embers start with something  not by wind alone  not by climate change alone  it would be prudent to try to find out what ignited the fires  if it is arson  then the arsonist  s  are responsible for the deaths and property destruction  we had many fires in oregon this summer  some were caused by lightning  some by human negligence  and a few were confirmed to be arson  |  SAD
i would favor negligence over arson  |  SAD
kristina black tara amano      but  so many  |  SAD
anne sheldon  your response is very measured and important  thank you  |  SAD

grant colley you are a despicable human being  |  SAD

janice blodgett i am not cheering the burning of california  you like to lie to vilify others  |  SAD
how about this grant do nt send  1 to california and we do nt send  1 to washington  guess who needs the money more  that is correct trump because out of every  1 california sends they get back 78 cents  the second least amount of federal money of all 50 states  now your state can subsidize mississippi and every poor southern state  is that a deal  |  SAD
john arcieri sources  ca gets plenty of federal dollars other than disaster money  |  SAD
 |  SAD
 mobilenytimescom20170208uscaliforniatodayfederaltaxeshtml |  SAD
this one finds it closer to even  ca gets 99 cents from the feds for every dollar it sends in  no matter how you look at it less than most other states    amphtml |  SAD
not that this should matter when it comes to individuals  worthiness  for disaster aid  people have died and lost their homes  just like in florida and in texas  we are still one country and the fact we can have differences in opinion but still come together when it s needed is part of what makes this country great  |  SAD
kara jane janssen do any of these take into account the cost of illegal immigrants  really  what difference does it make if ca does not respect federal law  ca is not a good citizen  |  SAD

this is truly terrifying  |  SAD
so scary  praying for all  |  SAD
i wonder how many arson among human activity induced fires  could controlled back burning or prescribed burning have mitigated the intensity of such fires  |  SAD
we had over 50 mph winds which caused phone lines and trees to ignite in forested areas  the wind carried and embers and fed the flames  it moved so quickly that people had no warning  we‚Äôre still focused on evacuating and there‚Äôs been no containment  |  SAD
absolutely horrible  hang in there  |  SAD
weinstein  a dear friend of the clinton s  |  SAD
one thing trump taught his cultist is that when he lies and makes stuff up that the gullible followers will eat it up like candy even if it lies on horse manure   |  SAD
shut up |  SAD
pbs wo nt even air it  |  SAD
