if the president overloads congress  and they get nothing done  does it strengthen the bannon  trump  mission to campaign against an  ineffective  congress during the 2018 primaries  |  HAH
according to paul ryan  this is the first time in 10 years congress is actually doing their jobs  they ve been  ineffective  for decades  maybe you should consider that before you reelect people who have been in office since nixon was president again  |  HAH
why do you even bother to assume any of them actually have a plan  their only aim is to destroy our democracy  and anything obama accomplished  when will you start questioning their actions and call them out for their heinous actions   |  HAH
our media is no longer interested in the truth  they are only interested in ratings and as such they cling to false equivalents and sensationalism to make that happen  |  HAH
is this an old interview  steve bannon has no job in the white house  or did i miss something  trumps always speaking out of both sides of his mouth  nothing new there  |  HAH
bannon is all over the news lately  do a search  |  HAH
bannon is no longer in the whitehouse  but they were talking like he still matters  not to me  |  HAH
i think we could have seen a child in k4 do a better job as potus  |  HAH
i ca nt decide if the donald trump whitehouse is a glorious boon for the media or a complete and utter nightmare  his mental illness certainly has them chasing their tails  i ll give him credit for that  |  HAH
he s cnn s alltime favorite person  |  HAH
the left wing media love him  do nt be fooled  and he loves them  |  HAH
hopefully they all go home because they are not on the right page  the congressional leaders who at this point in time are republicans need to have the guts to step up  even if they lose koch money  they may just win the respect of their constituents which i think is and should be very important to them  |  HAH
trump was elected to shake up not just washington but his own party  he has put into the laps of the republican congress issues they were elected to solve but have ignored before even trump was elected  they are part of the swamp |  HAH
this whole feud between a turd a pile of manure and chicken poo is totally fake  there‚Äôs nothing more fake |  HAH
it seems that they re gon na end up killing and eating each other  but they re full of surprises lately so i would nt bet the eggmoney on it  |  HAH
trump and banton are playing their followers for fools  maybe the most dangerous liaison we ve seen to date  please pay attention  |  HAH
the same page on twitter or in their private journals or in the congressional record or in the newspapers or in their talking point notes  |  HAH
is trump endorsing the candidates he wants to loose  using his low approval rate to sabotage there chances  |  HAH
if a russian nationalist was able to get elected to the oval office  i doubt he could do as much damage to our system as trump hasthey have they same agenda  alienate us from our allies in the eu and nato  reduce our credibility  cause chaos in congress  divide the left from the right  damage our trade with other countries and keep us busy with bs wars in the middle eastall without firing a single shotthey do nt even have to spy anymore because trump tweets every single thought  even bannons nationalist propaganda is better than sputnik  |  HAH
do nt waste your time with republicans  they are now effectively the russian party  start referring to them as the government of putin  gop  party  |  HAH
exhausted trying to keep up with the latest on these psychopaths  |  HAH
me to  going rip van winkle for a while  |  HAH
trump‚Äôs done and congress knows it  |  HAH

robert reich 4 hrs ¬∑ according to a recent quinnipiac poll  a majority of american voters now believe that trump is not ‚Äúfit to serve as president‚Äù but until now psychiatrists haven‚Äôt said much about trump‚Äôs mental because of the ‚Äúgoldwater rule  ‚Äù an ethical principle of the american psychiatric association that bars them from expressing professional opinions about public figures they haven‚Äôt personally examined  that‚Äôs over  ‚Äúbecause we were silenced by the goldwater rule  we failed to warn the public that they were heading over the niagara falls  ‚Äù says dr john gartner  a psychiatrist and founder of duty to warn  a group that aims to remove trump under the 25th amendment  duty to warn claims trump ‚Äúsuffers from an incurable malignant narcissism that makes him incapable of carrying out his presidential duties and poses a danger to the nation‚Äù sounds exactly right  on saturday  the group held kickoff events in 14 cities  where psychiatrists and other mentalhealth experts spoke out about trump‚Äôs dangerous mental condition  duty to warn participants have contributed essays to a new book  ‚Äúthe dangerous case of donald trump  27 psychiatrists and mental health experts assess a president  ‚Äù  which just made sunday‚Äôs times bestseller list   duty to warn has also announced the formation of the twentyfifth amendment pac   |  HAH

in the annals of history  they will be on the same lamentable page  |  HAH

a  there is no way of knowing what trump s iq is unless he took a legitimate test  some estimates are based on the fact that he was accepted to wharton  but even trump admitted that he got in because of a friendly admissions officer  perhaps made more friendly by daddy s bank account   b  judging from trump s  big word  vocabulary  the biggest words  all the best words   his linguistic intelligence is abysmal  and on top of that  based on his life history  his emotional intelligence  his interpersonal intelligence  and his existential  life smart  intelligence are all very low indeed  c  my point in b is completely supported by the fact that this man even needs to challenge a subordinate to an iq competition in the first place  |  HAH
for someone who is educated in private schools  he really is nt that smart  kind of tells you what the difference between private and public education can be  |  HAH
i do nt think that this one man can be used as a ruler to measure the success of all private schools  as i implied  he may have gotten into wharton  and he may have passed through their system with a degree  because of his father s wealth  it has been known to happen  |  HAH
