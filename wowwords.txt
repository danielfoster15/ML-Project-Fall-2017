i swear i hear this every time trump opens his insect mouth  |  WOW
he has nt made it thru the 1st term yetü§£ü§£ |  WOW
hey listen to this noise that caused hearing  cognitive  visual  balance  sleep and other problems   v |  WOW
‚Äúthe recordings themselves are not believed to be dangerous to those who listen  sound experts and physicians say they know of no sound that can cause physical damage when played for short durations at normal levels through standard equipment like a cellphone or computer‚Äù |  WOW
true but it was still funny üòÑ |  WOW
here  taste this  it s awful  |  WOW
brian molloy here  smell this milk  has it gone bad  üòú |  WOW
exactly what i was thinking   üîä |  WOW
omg  smell this  wouldja  jeez   |  WOW
i already have hearing issues  so not going to listen |  WOW
yeah  not going to listen üòä trust level is low lately  |  WOW
what i ca nt get my mind around is  why   it is my understanding that the cuban government has welcomed the progress made in diplomatic and economic relations with the us which are beneficial to both cuba and the us  this certainly warrants further investigation  something smells of sabotage  who  |  WOW
even in a totalitarian government  there exist groups of people with their own agendas  there could be elements of the  old guard  in cuba that are afraid that a warming of relations between the us and cuba could threaten their power  it is also possible that an american group  cia or rightwing cuban expats  could be behind it  |  WOW
exactly  which is why russia is trying to undo our success  we are at war  |  WOW
richard white  or russia  ü§î |  WOW
yes it could be russia  but i have to believe that both the cubans and ourselves have pretty good eyes on them  if it is the russians we probably already know it but just are nt saying  of course whether trump believes what the intelligence services tell him is a different matter  |  WOW
interesting  we have a recording of the sound but not one interview from an embassy staffer  all right after we open up diplomatic relations with cuba by president obama  very suspicious  why would cuba ruin their first chance for a normal future  |  WOW
i am extremely tormented by the sound of multiple cicadasgrew up in a very wooded areasounds very similar and gave me a similar reactionthose little bugs can seem deafening on a still  hot summer day  |  WOW
good comparison but i d say the cicadas are more whiny and this is more maybe whistley and shrill  i do nt mind the cicadas even when loud  |  WOW
i have no idea why this story does nt bother people more  people are field testing novel weapons against our embassy  |  WOW
this sound is a pitch just slightly lower than the white noise of my tiii just nnitis that i ve lived with as long as i can remember  i ve lived with it so long that i can tune it out  never had any other issues crop up because of it so i m puzzeled as to why all the other symptoms allegedly are being experienced  be interesting to see what others think who have tinnitis as well i just jave a hard time believing all of this anti cuba stuff |  WOW
couldn‚Äôt hear a thing  i also have tinnitus  maybe only younger peeps can hear it  |  WOW
gon na save it for the grands  let them try to hear it  |  WOW
i just got tinnitus in my right ear jan 3rd  of this year  i m still struggling with it  some times  when i m busy doing things in an environment with other sounds i do nt notice it as i am distracted  the weekends  when i am in a quiet house  it can be enough to set off panic attacks  depression  etc   i know that it is the last sound i will ever hear  it is there in the morning and when i try to sleep at night  wondering why more research has not been invested in this horrible thing  it has thrown my whole life out of balance  ughhh  |  WOW
i have some tinnitus  sometimes after a concert it can be quite loud and annoying but still not as shrill as this noise  the latter is definitely over stimulating the chalkboard scratching receptors  |  WOW
the towers that are being put up everywhere   mostly to the guise of cell phone use   are touted to have the ability to do many things  emw s are constant  all around us  tv towers  cell towers  all replacing the wire systems     how many suffering with just tinnitus  |  WOW
interesting that there is absolutely no background noise whatsoever  i work with audio a lot  and if this were a legitimate sampling of the sound in question  it would not sound like it was recorded in a studio  |  WOW
the source had to be close or everyone in the world would ve heard it  high frequency sound like that does nt go through walls very well  |  WOW
well when i clicked play on the sound i heard a portion of the sound recording and then a song jumped in and was playing so i do nt know if there s been some sort of mix up with the recording link |  WOW
i heard it  too  the song was weirder than the high pitched noise  |  WOW
i could nt figure why tne song was there either |  WOW
i can read the article but where i the the link for the sound is all i m getting is  this page ca nt be displayed      |  WOW
lots of russians left in cuba bet putin was not happy about losing his special spot to spy if the country try was opened up to the citizens of usa  |  WOW
for some reason i m not hearing anything unique from the recording even at higher volume levels  i was unable to find a link to the audio file itself  does anyone know where the file can be downloaded  thank you  |  WOW
with headphones on  after it played i felt just a little crosseyed and there s a slight ringing in my ears  yikes  |  WOW
that s almost exactly what my tinnitus sounds like  only sharper and more distinct  |  WOW
i thought the same thing  |  WOW
it‚Äôs hurtful as in biting aluminum foil on a cavity  very unique |  WOW
same with my tinnitus |  WOW
just that sample at low volume hurts  comparable to listening to sarah huckleberry sanders  |  WOW
the high pitched sound of gop dog whistles trying to sour improved relations with cuba  |  WOW
false flag to undo obama s progress with normalizing relations |  WOW
i do nt know even canadians experienced this and some folks have lost their hearing completely  |  WOW
trump isn‚Äôt that smart |  WOW
just sayin‚Äô  but shouldn‚Äôt i not listen to this  |  WOW
this story is in dire need of occam s razor |  WOW
why are they being called  attacks  if no one can explain them  |  WOW
but obama made sure cuba is our buddies  |  WOW
sounds to me like a bad baring in something mechanical  |  WOW
why would we want to hear this  rediculous  trying to make us sick  |  WOW
have they looked deeper to see if there is a tv broadcast of the 1936 olympics buried in the frequency   contact |  WOW
that would be unnerving  |  WOW
i hear this stuff all the time  no i m not crazy  |  WOW
i swear i heard a hidden message from satan  play it as fast as you can and you will hear satan too  |  WOW
faulty noise canceling device maybe or the white noise system in their office is set wrong  |  WOW
this  is  weird  want to know the truth but do nt want to know the truth  |  WOW
could it be that someone in the embassy forgot to switch something off  |  WOW
could this be ultra sonic rodent repellers that are going bad     |  WOW
atari computer system üò≥ battery going out  |  WOW
that is one irritating sound  |  WOW
just bc its happening in cuba does nt mean their the ones doing it  |  WOW
why didn‚Äôt they all start wearing headphones  |  WOW
and  depending on the flora in the yard or near the compound  perhaps there s a nest  lol |  WOW
it happened to canadians in cuba too  cuba and canada have good relations  perhaps some other country is involved   |  WOW
close the american outpost and sever ties  |  WOW
the russniks strike again  |  WOW
it‚Äôs aliens  |  WOW
earplugs  |  WOW
earplugs wouldn‚Äôt block it  they won‚Äôt even block the painful fire alarm sound in my apartment building  |  WOW
crazy |  WOW
uhhhhmmm  no  |  WOW
  sticker   |  WOW
bad bearing on an airhandling unit  |  WOW
faulty waveguide |  WOW
disgusting what they are doing üò© |  WOW
it s a stretch  but perhaps it s a unique  particular variety on nighttime cicada species  like this  but not    vshgux060re0 |  WOW
maria linda pilati |  WOW
