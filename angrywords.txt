gee john  the tax legislation hasn‚Äôt even been published and you‚Äôre assuming all sorts of evilgreed  what is your outline for tax equity  keep in mind that most income wealth results from abilities  diligenc  and thrift  |  ANG
read the pbs story  |  ANG
you need to study up a bit  to wit  1  half the population  including the poor  does nt pay income taxes to begin with  2  they re talking about increasing the standard deduction  not taking it away  the itemized deductions they re talking about cutting tend to benefit the wealthy much more  |  ANG
ted miller yes but this benefit trump and his heirs tremendously  supply side economics has never worked  |  ANG
hell john  i do nt care if the rich get richer  after all  they re the ones that invest and hire employees  or the companies they invest in do   my primary concern is that i do nt get any any poorer  i m retired and due to the stagnant economy i have nt had an increase in my retirement paycheck since jan 2001 the potus s  43  44 economic policies did nt do squat for me  in fact  i was penalized when my wife died because i now have to file as single  that increased my taxes while my income and outgo did nt change  because of the screwed up tax system needed to support all the entitlements for the  poor  i now have to pinch penny until lincoln squeals like a stuck pig  where is the support from the dems  who only want to increase taxes so they can spend it  to redo the tax code  frankly  i could do a lot better with a consumption tax because i d then have some control over my spending and taxes  and  i guess you think taxing manufacturing and other corporations is the answer do nt you  hello  they just pass those taxes on to the consumer with higher prices  boy  you need to stay away from the socialist s koolaid  |  ANG
raising the standard deduction will mean that fewer taxpayers will itemize  if fewer taxpayers itemize  then that will reduce the incentive for many of them to make charitable contributions or buy homes  especially among the middle class  charitable contributions  mortgage interest and local property taxes might still be deductible  but only if you itemize  |  ANG
we all know their tax plan favors the rich and getting rid of the estate tax is a huge win for all of them  they will still keep deductions by using them in their businesses just like they do now  not for middle america at all |  ANG
eliminating alternative minimum tax and estate tax will save rich people  like  45 and family  millions if not billions  when  45 says he does not benefit from his tax proposal  he is lying  bigly  |  ANG
they throw the masses crumbs while giving themselves the bakery  |  ANG
why is it considered a tax break  you are being doubled taxed if you pay taxes on state and local taxes   i thought you were not supposed to be double taxed  |  ANG
pers  biz income should be taxed once regardless of tax authority  hard to accmplish with multiple gvt levels needing funds  pers income taxfree states get there but their expenses are met with prop  sales  etc taxes  most states tax biz income but pers stockholders shouldn‚Äôt pay tax on dividends as biz pays a tax b4 distributing  maybe dividends like interest exp should be deductible instead  death  estate  taxes are worst example of double taxing  all peoples‚Äô property is bought with previously taxed income  in a previous admin  maybe clinton   eliminating deductions for 2nd homesyachts was attempted but failed politically  i favor the non deduct of 2nd home intprop tax  |  ANG
trump‚Äôs plan is a massive tax cut for the wealthy  cutting taxes for the wealthy few by an average of  40000 a year  trump would cut corporate taxes in half  and cut taxes on overseas profits to zero ‚Äì rewarding companies that send jobs overseas  his plan also includes a brand new tax loophole for highflying noncorporate businesses like law firms  investment funds  and donald trump‚Äôs own real estate empire  trump would eliminate the estate tax  a huge personal benefit to his children ‚Äì and millionaire heirs like them   remember  only estates over  11 million pay any estate tax   for middleclass families of 4  or more   the elimination of the standard deduction means a big tax increase  they‚Äôre even raising the tax rate on the poorest americans ‚Äì those making less than  9000 a year ‚Äì from 10  to 12   |  ANG
and the elimination of the estate tax actually increases income taxes  and the burden of compliance  for everyone  |  ANG

no big biz pays 35   effective tax rate  warren buffett says his secretary paid more taxes than him ge paid 5  trump  0  wait until they put numbers that correlate to the 3 brackets and let several economists evaluate the proposal remember trump promised the changes won‚Äôt help him and will be heavily weighted to the middle class |  ANG
i believe that the effective tax rate  for the trumptards that means  real  rate  paid by big business is around 14   when trump surreptitiously released his 2005 return  the only reason he paid a measly 20  rate was the alternative minimum tax  otherwise his tax rate would have been only 6  when he claims that the new tax plan  which eliminates the amt wo nt help him personally  it s just another one of his many bold faced lies  |  ANG
don has lied over 1000 times just president  do nt hold your breath  |  ANG
and here i am  thinking that the basis for allowing taxes paid to state government to be deductible on federal taxes was to keep us from paying taxes on taxes  whatever happened to that notion  |  ANG
reagan kind of killed that when he started taxing people social security taxes  that we already paid taxes on when we earned the money from which our social security came  |  ANG
well that seems unfair  even more recently  my 403  b  contributions before retirement were deducted from taxable earnings so that my retirement distributions are now taxable  seems the same principle should appy to social security as to other forms of retirement plans  like iras versus roth iras  |  ANG
dinah  granted that some lowerincome retirees may escape taxes on their social security benefits by formula  but higher income earners who retire with higher benefits and other retirement resources wind up paying taxes again on their social security benefits after having already paid taxes on their contributions  even other retirement plans like iras do nt work this way  |  ANG

democrats have known for 7 years now  that they did not appropriate the        legally  to then pay those subsidies  stop trying to blame trump for something democrats failed to do in 7 years since obamacare was enacted  trump is following the us constitution  that a federal court said obama was not doing  that constitutional scholar knows the us house of representatives appropriates the         they did not care  they could have fixed it at any time over those 7 years but failed to do sowho controlled the house in 2010 and are the ones that legally appropriate funds  the republican controlled us house in 2010 obama did not care  because they never expected to lose to trump  |  ANG

washington ‚Äï president donald trump threatened to pull the us out of the iran nuclear agreement if congress doesn‚Äôt amend an existing law in a way that changes us commitments under the agreement ‚Äï a move that could in itself destroy the socalled joint comprehensive plan of action  ‚Äúin the event we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies  then the agreement will be terminated  ‚Äù trump said friday in a speech from the white house  ‚Äúit is under continuous review  and our participation can be canceled by me  as president  at any time‚Äù under the 2015 jcpoa  negotiated between iran  the us and five other countries  iran has significantly scaled back its nuclear program and allowed broad access to international inspectors in exchange for sanctions relief from the international community  some of the restrictions on the number of centrifuges iran can have spinning and the amount of uranium it can enrich will expire between 10 and 15 years from when the agreement was implemented  trump‚Äôs preference  he said friday  is for congress to revise an existing us law in a way that makes those restrictions on iran‚Äôs nuclear program permanent  the revised law would also reimpose sanctions that were lifted under the nuclear accord if iran takes certain steps related to its ballistic missile program  trump said  senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  rtenn  and sen tom cotton  rark   have already started drafting such legislation  working in coordination with the white house  it is unclear whether the envisioned legislation would have the votes to pass  democrats  including some who voted against implementing the deal in 2015  so far have lined up against the proposal  rep eliot engel  ny   the ranking democrat on the house foreign affairs committee  slammed trump‚Äôs iran plan as an unrealistic attempt to unilaterally change the terms of an international agreement  ‚Äúthe president‚Äôs plan doesn‚Äôt make sense  negotiating additional terms to the nuclear deal requires a coalition of international partners  not unilateral congressional action  ‚Äù engel  who opposed the deal in 2015  said in a statement  ‚Äúi strongly disagree with the president‚Äôs reckless  political decision and his subsequent threat to congress  at a moment when the united states and its allies face a nuclear crisis with north korea  the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners  compromising our ability to employ a diplomatic surge on the korean peninsula  ‚Äù said rep ben cardin  md    the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee  who also previously opposed the iran deal  calling on lawmakers to redefine the iran deal  cardin said  is reminiscent of how trump handled immigration and health care policies  the president ‚Äúis abdicating his leadership role to congress  just like with dreamers and just like with affirming and strengthening our health care system  it is a troubling pattern  we will not buy into the false premise that it is congress‚Äô role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making  ‚Äù cardin‚Äôs statement continued  the key criticism against the trump administration‚Äôs proposal is that it rests on the assumption the us can unilaterally change its obligations under an international agreement without facing major blowback from iran or any of the other countries who helped negotiate the deal  iran‚Äôs foreign ministry warned that it would consider the nuclear agreement null if it stops receiving the benefits it was guaranteed under the 2015 agreement  ‚Äúthe islamic republic of iran will not be the first to withdraw from the deal  but if its rights and interests in the deal are not respected  it will stop implementing all its commitments and will resume its peaceful nuclear program without any restrictions  ‚Äù the foreign ministry said in a statement  ‚Äúthe president‚Äôs gambit is irresponsible and dangerous  ‚Äù daryl g kimball  executive director of the arms control association  wrote in a statement  ‚Äúany attempt by the white house or congress to unilaterally change the terms of the highlysuccessful nuclear deal with iran risks setting washington on a course to violate the deal‚Äù trump‚Äôs speech follows a lengthy interagency review and months of speculation about whether he would scrap the nuclear deal or toss the decision to congress  throughout the review  trump reportedly pressured his aides to come up with a way to leave the iran deal ‚Äï even as members of his cabinet recommended remaining party to the agreement  secretary of defense james mattis testified earlier this month that abiding by the agreement is consistent with us national security interests  secretary of state rex tillerson explicitly told reporters on thursday  hours before trump threatened to terminate the agreement  that the administration planned to remain in it  the administration‚Äôs plan  previewed by tillerson on thursday  appeared to be a delicately crafted effort by trump‚Äôs advisers to give him the chance to deliver a toughsounding speech on iran while tossing to congress the consequential part of the decision about the nuclear accord‚Äôs future  tillerson did not indicate on thursday any plans for trump to threaten to scuttle the agreement if he didn‚Äôt get his way with lawmakers  trump also appeared to go beyond what tillerson had previewed on thursday when he announced his decision to authorize the treasury department to sanction ‚Äúthe entire islamic revolutionary guard corps for its support for terrorism‚Äù tillerson said thursday the administration would sanction irgclinked individuals and entities but would avoid sanctioning the entire military group because of potential complications if us troops encounter irgc troops on the battlefield  after months of waiving sanctions against iran and certifying its compliance  trump appeared to relish the opportunity to rail against what he described as a murderous ‚Äúiranian dictatorship‚Äù he spent the first several minutes of his speech listing various grievances against the iranian regime  the iran hostage crisis that began in 1979  the 1983 marine barracks bombing in beirut  and iran‚Äôs support for various terrorist groups that threaten the us trump accused iran of committing ‚Äúmultiple violations‚Äù of the nuclear agreement ‚Äï hours after tillerson acknowledged iran is ‚Äúunder technical compliance‚Äù with the terms of the jcpoa  the apparent violations trump referred to have been described by experts as ‚Äúminor infraction  s  ‚Äù that were quickly rectified  the international atomic energy agency  tasked with monitoring the use of nuclear energy  has now confirmed iranian compliance with the nuclear deal eight times  despite having the entire us intelligence community at his disposal  trump relied on vague assertions of iranian wrongdoing to build his case  ‚Äúthere are also many people who believe that iran is dealing with north korea  ‚Äù trump said friday  adding that he would direct the intelligence community to do a ‚Äúthorough analysis‚Äù of the issue  former secretary of state john kerry  who led the us negotiating team throughout the iran deal talks  accused trump of ‚Äúcreating an international crisis‚Äù and urged lawmakers to act as a bulwark against the president‚Äôs plan  ‚Äúpresident trump‚Äôs decision today is dangerous  ‚Äù kerry said in a statement  ‚Äúit‚Äôs a reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology from a president who would rather play a highstakes game of chicken with congress and with iran than admit that the nuclear agreement is working‚Äù this story has been updated to include comments from iran‚Äôs foreign ministry and former secretary of state john kerry  |  ANG

i m an adherent to the 10th amendment   the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution  nor prohibited by it to the states  are reserved to the states respectively  or to the people   i have no problem with individual states adopting and implementing a type of universal healthcare program  but have issues with the federal govt creating one  one could make the argument that if health care is a right and people therefore should not be denied access  then through the 2nd amendment  i should be able to have my guns  arms  given to me by the federal govt  paid for by john  jane taxpayer  i also am against paying for someone s healthcare if the condition they are in is selfinflicted  heart disease  diabetes  etc  as a result of poor diet and lack of exercise  or they blew off their fingers lighting off fireworks  i can see the argument made regarding the  general welfare   but it is a broad and subjective term  i feel unless it is explicitly stated in the constitution  then the federal govt has no right to be involved  |  ANG
and if you joined a wellregulated militia  i would fully support the federal government paying for your arms  though i suspect your definition of wellregulated  would not match mine  the national guard is welcome to my taxes  as to paying for someone else s healthcare  you already do  regardless of type of injury or illness  as long as it is a forprofit business  it is going to have to be paid for  and basic economic truths tell us the majority of that is going to rest on the middle class  at least in terms of percentage of income  which limits their spending power  which in turn degrades our country s economic health  i understand the urge for a strict interpretation of the constitution  but i fear that does a disservice to the constitution itself  the country it is intended to guide and to humanity in general  and i know you understand the need for the evolution of our governing documents  or you d have more to say about the 35s compromise and every amendment added after initial ratification  as an aside  you imply here that you d be fine paying for other people s healthcare as long as they allowed you  or someone else  to legislate their diet and exercise regimen  that does nt seem very libertarian of you  |  ANG

trump will scrap the iran deal  they will ramp up nuclear development  and trump will blame obama  or hillary  or mccain  or someone in his cabinet  or corker  or great britain  etc  |  ANG
turn it into another north korea  he manages that situation so well  not to mention  there will be no country to take the us seriously after that  but hey  ivanka got 100 mill from the saudies and trademark from the chinese  so america is already great for her    |  ANG
dotard always needs 2 of something  one for each hand  in this case  nuclear crises  he already has north korea and he needs iran too  |  ANG
really    taunting north korea and now wants to put his scummy hands into iran who has been volatile since 1979  he really is trying to start world war 3 |  ANG
what i know is scraping the iranian deal makes a dangerous world more dangerous  it could lead to me being nuked  my family could be nuked  my friends  neighbors and community could be nuked  my country could be entangled in a war in the near east as well as a war in n korea  many of my countrymen could be nuked  and why  negotiations over years have kept a very unstable world just short of nuclear war  we need to continue negotiating  not threaten everyone  why is trump making a scary world worse  |  ANG
trump s tirades over iran and north korea is going to get a lot of americans killed and it s not going to help anything  this is all about his ego  |  ANG
i think the damage is done already  hopefully  iran will stick with the deal no matter what we do in hopes the other nations will continue to invest and trade with them  this is totally a self inflicted wound  the only bright spot i can see is senator corker and the other republicans that fixed it so the president would have to recertify every 90 days thought they would be poking a finger in hillary clinton s eye but now they have to deal with president trump and we the people will pay the price  |  ANG
can we just say trump will attempt to scrap every policy enacted under president obama and probably some enacted by presidents clinton and the two bushes  and carter  he needs to destroy to make himself feel important  |  ANG
stupid stupid stupid stupid  repeal all the progress the other party made just because it was  them   i thought we were all americans  |  ANG
also with all the distractions everyone seems to have missed the fbi investigation into personal email being used to conduct white house business by trumps daughter and two other white house cabinet members  the same sin that trump was insisting clinton be sent to prison for  this was on bbc america  |  ANG
tim huff  there is so much coming every day about the trump family and administration  i ve seen articles about daughter and soninlaw using private email accounts to conduct wh  business  but of course  that s different from hc doing it  |  ANG
a big part of trumps platform was that he could make deals  he actually hasnt made a single significant deal yet  not even with his own party on healthcare when they all agree they dont want obamacare  i do nt think he will make any worthwhile deals with iran  |  ANG
scrapping the deal frees iran immediately restore their nuclear program  how is that making anything better  seems pretty dumb  does nt it  in his desire to soothe his own ego and play the great deal maker  he has no qualms with making things worse  he may have been comfortable with faking that he d walk away from a real estate deal  but that does nt translate to the presidency  trump plays with other s lives and money as if they were nothing more than tokens on a game board  he feels no pain  he has no true empathy for americans  he has no skin in the game other than his ego and desire for adoration and adulation  he has shown that he ll go to any length to get it  and if he does nt  he ll seek vengeance and destruction regardless of how many innocent people  including his supporters  get swept up in it as collateral damage  |  ANG
let s hope he moves on to the next topic to distract him like the size of his hands or the big big words that he knows  |  ANG
look a plane |  ANG
i invented fake   |  ANG
if this coarse venal little bully thinks he can intimidate iran  he ought to try reading their history  starting with cia shenanigans and putting the evil shah in power  it will take more than this chief twit to intimidate iran  and having complied with international accords  iran deserves a little respect  but not as long as the israeil lobby controls congress  |  ANG
trump is a pos  but he is right on this one  it was a bad deal  iran has not stopped their nuclear program  and they got a couple of billion usd to help facilitate it  breaking the agreement will neither hurt nor help iran s nuke ambitions  |  ANG
show your evidence  with all your information why are you here on fb  you had better contact the authorities  |  ANG
gary bailey its my opinion  that s all  and that should be good enough for you  |  ANG
and if iran has nt stopped  why not argue from a point of strength with the agreement in your favor  why cancel the agreement and cut all your leverage  because you re trump and you have no idea what you re doing  but you know that obama precipitated the agreement and you hate obama  |  ANG
scott smaistria you basically know better than the men who are doing the inspections and reinspections because your opinion beats out facts every time  |  ANG
you just made that up  |  ANG
scott smaistrla  iran has not stopped their nuclear program  is not an opinion  it s either a fact or a lie  if it s a fact  you should be able to provide evidence of it  |  ANG
ok  he should have said it is his worry that they have nt stopped  i have the same worry but any country could be doing the same underground  i remember way before the n korean publicity the problems the inspectors were having getting access to facilities and iran trying to further enrich uranium  it s a scary world we re one day someone crazy or with an itchy trigger finger is gon na cause a catastrophe  we need to tread carefully  and i m certain scrapping the deal is the wrong direction  |  ANG
what would we do if some foreign nation told us that it had decided to  negotiate  us into a reduced state of defense and that we had no choice  |  ANG
sure is nice nice that international treaties no longer have to be approved by the senate  that pesky constitution is best ignored  right  |  ANG
mr trump can not scrap this agreement  he can treat us citizens with contempt but needs to take more care with the rest of the world  |  ANG
what i need to know is what congress is going to do about this crazy  megalomaniac who is putting us all in great danger  |  ANG
unfortunately he has a massive following of people who are falling for the propaganda  die hard republicans who will back anyone being republican  i m neutral and have voted both ways but it is usually always democrat  but i do my studying  of history and of the candidate  he appealed to the massive christian population by suddenly becoming a christian himself despite his history  his language  his behavior   makes people a whole new aspect of  moving forward blindly  they do nt see that cliff  |  ANG
sadly  you are right |  ANG
scrapping the iran nuclear agreement only adds fuel to the fire from north korea  how could they expect our country to honor any negotiated nuclear agreement with them   |  ANG
when i said things against trump  it s good for their business or causes in that matter but nothing happened  i do nt count  so why not say great things about pr trump  you might say bad things to me for that  but who cares  |  ANG
comon guys what world are we living  trump is smarter than who we think he is  he perfectly understands how america  and modern capitalism works  do you think really the news media thinks your ideals  and progressive agendas are their primary concern  not  their priority is to find and air the hottest stories that fuel their business  |  ANG
and when i say these things i have zero agendas my self  and i m not a communist and i do nt advocate one specific nation  or anything  and i have a very strong beliefs on social justice and utopian democracy  but the reality is that those ideas are far from the present reality  am i wrong  you have to get to work the first thing in the morning is your priority whether to make money or to pursue what you think is the most important thing in that sense  we got some mental duplicity  we tend to justify our actions for it advances our interest  let s wake up  or am i the only one waking up to the true reality  |  ANG
look i used to look at this world more rosily  always trying to pursue good causes  while i was in the middle school   from that on  i used to give away so much money though it was nt my money i earned  but were allowances from my family  believing those fine causes  also in good faith that what goes around comes around  whenever i did such things  my parents would tell me that i m being so naive and detached from our reality  that it s a constant survival and competition game that we re living in  i know you believe good causes  most journalists believe in good causes including social justice and happy world  but most likely not at the expense of their own benefits  |  ANG
