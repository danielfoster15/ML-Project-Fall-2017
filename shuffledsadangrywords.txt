and if you joined a wellregulated militia  i would fully support the federal government paying for your arms  though i suspect your definition of wellregulated  would not match mine  the national guard is welcome to my taxes  as to paying for someone else s healthcare  you already do  regardless of type of injury or illness  as long as it is a forprofit business  it is going to have to be paid for  and basic economic truths tell us the majority of that is going to rest on the middle class  at least in terms of percentage of income  which limits their spending power  which in turn degrades our country s economic health  i understand the urge for a strict interpretation of the constitution  but i fear that does a disservice to the constitution itself  the country it is intended to guide and to humanity in general  and i know you understand the need for the evolution of our governing documents  or you d have more to say about the 35s compromise and every amendment added after initial ratification  as an aside  you imply here that you d be fine paying for other people s healthcare as long as they allowed you  or someone else  to legislate their diet and exercise regimen  that does nt seem very libertarian of you  |  ANG

washington ‚Äï president donald trump threatened to pull the us out of the iran nuclear agreement if congress doesn‚Äôt amend an existing law in a way that changes us commitments under the agreement ‚Äï a move that could in itself destroy the socalled joint comprehensive plan of action  ‚Äúin the event we are not able to reach a solution working with congress and our allies  then the agreement will be terminated  ‚Äù trump said friday in a speech from the white house  ‚Äúit is under continuous review  and our participation can be canceled by me  as president  at any time‚Äù under the 2015 jcpoa  negotiated between iran  the us and five other countries  iran has significantly scaled back its nuclear program and allowed broad access to international inspectors in exchange for sanctions relief from the international community  some of the restrictions on the number of centrifuges iran can have spinning and the amount of uranium it can enrich will expire between 10 and 15 years from when the agreement was implemented  trump‚Äôs preference  he said friday  is for congress to revise an existing us law in a way that makes those restrictions on iran‚Äôs nuclear program permanent  the revised law would also reimpose sanctions that were lifted under the nuclear accord if iran takes certain steps related to its ballistic missile program  trump said  senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker  rtenn  and sen tom cotton  rark   have already started drafting such legislation  working in coordination with the white house  it is unclear whether the envisioned legislation would have the votes to pass  democrats  including some who voted against implementing the deal in 2015  so far have lined up against the proposal  rep eliot engel  ny   the ranking democrat on the house foreign affairs committee  slammed trump‚Äôs iran plan as an unrealistic attempt to unilaterally change the terms of an international agreement  ‚Äúthe president‚Äôs plan doesn‚Äôt make sense  negotiating additional terms to the nuclear deal requires a coalition of international partners  not unilateral congressional action  ‚Äù engel  who opposed the deal in 2015  said in a statement  ‚Äúi strongly disagree with the president‚Äôs reckless  political decision and his subsequent threat to congress  at a moment when the united states and its allies face a nuclear crisis with north korea  the president has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners  compromising our ability to employ a diplomatic surge on the korean peninsula  ‚Äù said rep ben cardin  md    the ranking democrat on the senate foreign relations committee  who also previously opposed the iran deal  calling on lawmakers to redefine the iran deal  cardin said  is reminiscent of how trump handled immigration and health care policies  the president ‚Äúis abdicating his leadership role to congress  just like with dreamers and just like with affirming and strengthening our health care system  it is a troubling pattern  we will not buy into the false premise that it is congress‚Äô role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making  ‚Äù cardin‚Äôs statement continued  the key criticism against the trump administration‚Äôs proposal is that it rests on the assumption the us can unilaterally change its obligations under an international agreement without facing major blowback from iran or any of the other countries who helped negotiate the deal  iran‚Äôs foreign ministry warned that it would consider the nuclear agreement null if it stops receiving the benefits it was guaranteed under the 2015 agreement  ‚Äúthe islamic republic of iran will not be the first to withdraw from the deal  but if its rights and interests in the deal are not respected  it will stop implementing all its commitments and will resume its peaceful nuclear program without any restrictions  ‚Äù the foreign ministry said in a statement  ‚Äúthe president‚Äôs gambit is irresponsible and dangerous  ‚Äù daryl g kimball  executive director of the arms control association  wrote in a statement  ‚Äúany attempt by the white house or congress to unilaterally change the terms of the highlysuccessful nuclear deal with iran risks setting washington on a course to violate the deal‚Äù trump‚Äôs speech follows a lengthy interagency review and months of speculation about whether he would scrap the nuclear deal or toss the decision to congress  throughout the review  trump reportedly pressured his aides to come up with a way to leave the iran deal ‚Äï even as members of his cabinet recommended remaining party to the agreement  secretary of defense james mattis testified earlier this month that abiding by the agreement is consistent with us national security interests  secretary of state rex tillerson explicitly told reporters on thursday  hours before trump threatened to terminate the agreement  that the administration planned to remain in it  the administration‚Äôs plan  previewed by tillerson on thursday  appeared to be a delicately crafted effort by trump‚Äôs advisers to give him the chance to deliver a toughsounding speech on iran while tossing to congress the consequential part of the decision about the nuclear accord‚Äôs future  tillerson did not indicate on thursday any plans for trump to threaten to scuttle the agreement if he didn‚Äôt get his way with lawmakers  trump also appeared to go beyond what tillerson had previewed on thursday when he announced his decision to authorize the treasury department to sanction ‚Äúthe entire islamic revolutionary guard corps for its support for terrorism‚Äù tillerson said thursday the administration would sanction irgclinked individuals and entities but would avoid sanctioning the entire military group because of potential complications if us troops encounter irgc troops on the battlefield  after months of waiving sanctions against iran and certifying its compliance  trump appeared to relish the opportunity to rail against what he described as a murderous ‚Äúiranian dictatorship‚Äù he spent the first several minutes of his speech listing various grievances against the iranian regime  the iran hostage crisis that began in 1979  the 1983 marine barracks bombing in beirut  and iran‚Äôs support for various terrorist groups that threaten the us trump accused iran of committing ‚Äúmultiple violations‚Äù of the nuclear agreement ‚Äï hours after tillerson acknowledged iran is ‚Äúunder technical compliance‚Äù with the terms of the jcpoa  the apparent violations trump referred to have been described by experts as ‚Äúminor infraction  s  ‚Äù that were quickly rectified  the international atomic energy agency  tasked with monitoring the use of nuclear energy  has now confirmed iranian compliance with the nuclear deal eight times  despite having the entire us intelligence community at his disposal  trump relied on vague assertions of iranian wrongdoing to build his case  ‚Äúthere are also many people who believe that iran is dealing with north korea  ‚Äù trump said friday  adding that he would direct the intelligence community to do a ‚Äúthorough analysis‚Äù of the issue  former secretary of state john kerry  who led the us negotiating team throughout the iran deal talks  accused trump of ‚Äúcreating an international crisis‚Äù and urged lawmakers to act as a bulwark against the president‚Äôs plan  ‚Äúpresident trump‚Äôs decision today is dangerous  ‚Äù kerry said in a statement  ‚Äúit‚Äôs a reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology from a president who would rather play a highstakes game of chicken with congress and with iran than admit that the nuclear agreement is working‚Äù this story has been updated to include comments from iran‚Äôs foreign ministry and former secretary of state john kerry  |  ANG

monica crist  here is a little summary  history lesson   when united states navy warship ‚Äúgloucester‚Äù pulled into gu√°nica bay in the early morning hours of july 25  1898  puerto rico became our responsibility  when the disembarking sailors lowered the spanish flag from the port flagpole and hoisted the american flag  puerto rico became our responsibility  when the puerto rican house of delegates voted unanimously in 1914 to be free of us rule and the us congress refused to recognize their independence  puerto rico was our responsibility  when the us congress passed the jonesshafroth act on march 2  1917 declaring all puerto ricans born after april 10  1899 to be fullfledged us citizens  puerto rico was our responsibility  did you catch that  in 1917  the year the law was passed  people born in 1899 would be turning 18 ‚Äì legal draft age  the law was passed on march 2  1917 the us entered wwi on april 6  1917 when we gave this grant of citizenship in 1917 over the unanimous objection of all representatives in the puerto rican house of delegates who believed the grant of citizenship was primarily for the purpose of drafting puerto rican men into military service  puerto rico was our responsibility  when section 1402 of title 8 of the us code was amended in 1952 to declare that all puerto ricans born after january 13  1941 are natural born american citizens  puerto rico was our responsibility  when the republican congress passed ‚Äì and bill clinton signed ‚Äì legislation in 1996 beginning a tenyear phaseout of fdr new deal tax incentives for us corporations to create taxfree earnings through subsidiaries operating in puerto rico  the failure of the economy of puerto rico became our responsibility  when the consequent tenyear mass exodus of us companies and jobs was complete in 2005 and the economy of puerto rico began contracting  the financial plight of puerto rico became our responsibility  when the us congress made all interest on municipal bonds issued by puerto rico free of federal  state  and local taxes  causing wall street fund managers to pour loanedmoney into the puerto rican government like water pouring over the broken levees of lake pontchartrain  the debt of puerto rico became our responsibility  this is history  |  SAD
