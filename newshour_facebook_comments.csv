By ""enforcing code"" on such a neglected area they're really forcing land owners to sell. I've seen it before, when Dallas wants to flip a whole neighborhood they enforce code on whoever owns the most property, that property owner sells (usually to a holdings co. or developer).

Congressional Republicans are seriously contemplating scrapping the Federal tax credit for the mortgage interest payments. This would inevitably lead to the fall in home ownership by regular people, who would live or otherwise use the properties themselves, as there would be no financial advantage to owning vs. renting.

However, various venture capitalists and investors can come in when the market hits the bottom and sweep up properties on the cheap. And they would never sell - only rent them out to people who’d otherwise have opted to own but now require rental housing. The landlords would keep raising the rent, would not effect repairs, and boot the tenants out at will - and charge the next tenant a higher rent.",Akiko Abe,2017-10-17 13:02:46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So let's take a step back. Now if we were to try to solve this problem by say raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. What would actually happen is that landlords and Property Management companies would simply raised rents to the amount that they could afford and suck that extra money right out of their pockets. The key is to combine the two issues. If you were to give the tax breaks that the president wants to give to the wealthy let's say targeted at people with rental properties that would encourage them to buy more rental properties and people who build affordable housing or just housing of any type. And give them massive tax cuts per unit. With a goal of let's say tripling the amount of homes that are available with the stipulation that they be built into the environment not on top of it. And green!. The surplus of housing would drive down the cost. If we could get the cost to say drop by $500 then that's $500 a month each household would actually have extra. Once this is done then we would only have to raise the minimum wage that's a $3.25. That would add basically another $500 to every household that earns minimum wage that would put about $1,000 a month into all of these households. And it would be sustainable without having to enforce rent controls or anything like that. The effect of this would be that people would be able to buy cars buy homes. As well as more things further homes from Home Depot or Lowe's and places like that. Which would mean they would have to hire more people.

Trump held a press conference today during which he excused his failure to make phone calls to the families of military members recently killed in action by claiming that many past presidents haven’t made such calls. It was another blatant Trump lie.

San Antonio Spurrs head coach Gregg Popovich—an Air Force veteran and arguably the best coach in the NBA, and famous for not liking to talk to reporters -- was so angered by the lie that he made an unsolicited call to “The Nation’s” David Zarin. This is what Popovich said:

""This man in the Oval Office is a soulless coward who thinks that he can only become large by belittling others. This has of course been a common practice of his, but to do it in this manner—and to lie about how previous Presidents responded to the deaths of soldiers—is as low as it gets. We have a pathological liar in the White House: unfit intellectually, emotionally, and psychologically to hold this office and the whole world knows it, especially those around him every day. The people who work with this President should be ashamed because they know it better than anyone just how unfit he is, and yet they choose to do nothing about it. This is their shame most of all.""",Daniel Craig,2017-10-17 22:05:15,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have a chronic condition that required major pelvic and abdominal surgery 6 weeks ago and was weaned off narcotics within 48 hours and sent home with nothing more than tylenol and ibuprofen (which damages my stomach).  I've never had issues with opioid addiction and have been prescribed narcotics in the past after surgery; but now I find myself without an important tool in my post-op recovery.  Thankfully, the worst is behind me but I wouldn't wish the pain from those first couple weeks on anybody! Going through support groups and anecdotes online, this story is becoming VERY common.

WHY YOU SHOULD INVEST IN BITCOIN CRYTOCURRENCY

Few years back, 1 BTC was sold for ₦200 ($1 Dollar) per coin and today the price of 1 BTC is over ₦400,000 (over $5,000), Just imagine your ₦200 or $1 investment turns to ₦400,000 or $5,000. What a wide margin! It's not too late for you to make money through Bitcoin investment.

According to a recent Quinnipiac poll, a majority of American voters now believe that Trump is not “fit to serve as President.”
But until now psychiatrists haven’t said much about Trump’s mental because of the “Goldwater Rule,” an ethical principle of the American Psychiatric Association that bars them from expressing professional opinions about public figures they haven’t personally examined.
That’s over. “Because we were silenced by the Goldwater Rule, we failed to warn the public that they were heading over the Niagara Falls,” says Dr. John Gartner, a psychiatrist and founder of Duty to Warn, a group that aims to remove Trump under the 25th Amendment. Duty to Warn claims Trump “suffers from an incurable malignant narcissism that makes him incapable of carrying out his presidential duties and poses a danger to the nation.”
Sounds exactly right. On Saturday, the group held kickoff events in 14 cities, where psychiatrists and other mental-health experts spoke out about Trump’s dangerous mental condition.
Duty to Warn participants have contributed essays to a new book, “The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 27 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President,” -- which just made Sunday’s Times best-seller list. (Duty to Warn has also announced the formation of the Twenty-fifth Amendment PAC.)",Daniel Craig,2017-10-16 21:24:46,10,10,0,0,0,0,0,0

April 24, 2015
By Hanan Parvez

Crossing the arms across the chest is a classic gesture of defensiveness. This defensiveness can manifest as uneasiness, shyness or insecurity.

When a person feels threatened by a situation, he crosses his arms across his chest creating a barrier that helps him protect his vital organs- the lungs and the heart.

When a person finds himself in an undesirable situation, you'll find him folding his arms and if the undesirability is intense, the arms-crossing may be accompanied by legs-crossing.

A person who's waiting for someone and is feeling awkward at the same time might do this gesture. 

In a group the person who doesn’t feel confident is usually the one who has his arms crossed. 

When someone suddenly hears a bad news, he instantly crosses his arms as if to symbolically ‘protect himself’ from the bad news.

You'll also observe this gesture when a person feels offended. Defense is a natural reaction to an offence. When someone is humiliated or criticized, he’s likely to cross his arms to assume the defensive mode. 

If you see two people talking and one of them suddenly crosses his arms, you can safely assume that the other said or did something that the first person didn't like.

folded arms

Defensiveness + hostility

If the arms are crossed and the fists are clenched then this indicates an attitude of hostility in addition to defensiveness. 

We clench our fists when we're angry and are about to punch someone, literally or symbolically. This is a very negative body language position that a person can acquire and you should try to figure out what’s bothering the person before continuing your interaction with them.",Beth Hengst,2017-10-17 03:25:25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

of corporate  America.  The drug companies and their “pushers” and  their highly paid lawyers and their cohorts  in the USA Congress have killed thousands—THOUSANDS! of American citizens— by turning them into opioid addicts so they would have a mass market for their product.  They used their money & influence on Congressional members to totally gut the regulatory agencies so they can literally get away with murder.
They started out by convincing the doctors of America that opioids were the perfect solution for pain relief — no side affects—  and — non addictive!
By the time their lies were outed it was too late — opioid addiction spread through America like a wildfire!

As I see it, giving a drug that stops death from occurring from an overdose is not a solution.  Just makes it more appealing if you know you aren't going to die.  Need to start teaching our young that they don't need instant gratification, that bad things happen to everyone, that curiosity about places, ideas and creativity is the spice of life.  Tell schools to stop burdening our children with negativity and guilt so that they think life isn't worth living,  As for adults, get a life. Be glad you are alive.  There are many people with illnesses where there is no recovery.  I am for spending dollars on finding cures for those illnesses instead of bringing drug addicts back from a bad decision, only to repeat it.

My primary concern is that I don't get any any poorer. I'm retired and due to the stagnant economy I haven't had an increase in my retirement paycheck since Jan 2001. The POTUS's # 43 & 44 economic policies didn't do squat for me. In fact, I was penalized when my wife died because I now have to file as single. That increased my taxes while my income and outgo didn't change. Because of the screwed up tax system needed to support all the entitlements for the ""poor"" I now have to pinch penny until Lincoln squeals like a stuck pig. Where is the support from the Dems (who only want to increase taxes so they can spend it) to redo the tax code?

Trump would cut corporate taxes in half, and cut taxes on overseas profits to zero – rewarding companies that send jobs overseas. 

His plan also includes a brand new tax loophole for high-flying non-corporate businesses like law firms, investment funds, and Donald Trump’s own real estate empire.

Trump would eliminate the estate tax, a huge personal benefit to his children – and millionaire heirs like them. (Remember, only estates over $11 million pay any estate tax.)

I just wonder what criteria would qualify for inclusion in such a head count? As unacceptable as harrassment and assualt are they are on the low end of the scale compared to the countless cases of those who have been abducted and forced to work in the sex trade. Perhaps this is the positive aspect of cases such as Bill Cosby or trump bringing this issue into more of an open discussion publically. Like a drunk or drug addict that must first admit there is a problem before steps toward a cure can begin.

The humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico, by the numbers:
More than 80 percent: The portion of the island’s electric grid that is not functioning.
28 percent: The share of Puerto Rican residents who lack running water.
72 percent: The share of residents who have running water and thus are subject to the health department recommendation that people boil or disinfect their water before drinking it.
100 percent: The share who are in one of the two previous categories.
40 percent: The share of residents who lack a cellphone signal.
20, out of 51: The number of sewage-treatment plants not functioning.
5, out of 18: The number of toxic-waste sites that have not been inspected by the Environmental Protection Agency since the hurricane.
Close to half: The portion of hospitals without electricity.
48: The official death toll, although health experts believe — and media reports suggest — the real number to be higher.

More precisely, the US adopts a differential strategy: it acts as if it continues to trust the MAD logic in its relations with Russia and China, while it is tempted to practise NUTS with Iran and North Korea.

The paradoxical mechanism of MAD inverts the logic of the ‘self-realizing prophecy’ into a ‘self-stultifying intention’: the very fact that each side can be sure that, should it decide to launch a nuclear attack, the other side will respond with full destructive force, guarantees that no side will start a war. The logic of NUTS is, on the contrary, that the enemy can be forced to disarm if it is assured that we can strike at them without risking a counter-attack. The very fact that two directly contradictory strategies are mobilized simultaneously by the same superpower bears witness to the fantasmatic character of this entire reasoning.""

Al-Abadi will commit murder in the north against the Kurds, their energy will be sapped, then they will have to deal with a pincer movement, caught between Daesh in the north (who will take the chance to regroup), and al-Sadr's followers (including remnants of the Mahdi Army left behind by UK forces when they had to retreat) in the south. It just depends on how patient al-Sadr is and whether he prefers to work with al-Abadi in the meantime in his and his followers' own interests. But Iraq is going to see more civil war.

If guns were banned, especially semi auto weapons, this couldn't have happened. Martial arts weaponry with tasers attached, can facilitate the rights to bear arms, without killing people. football players have every right to kneel, an trumpet shouldn't state otherwise. rights granted by our constitution of freedoms of speech an protest, don't stop at the work place. those companies need to realize contracts can't skirt law. the american revolution was not a change of law, filed in a court, and then voted on. ""it. was. a. riot."" if the ones that make the laws are wrong in making them, they aren't going to change those laws they wanted. if the police enforce these laws on we the people, then in that case, nothing can be filed, nothing can actually sway them to change said laws. ..except a riot/new revolution. if you want a peaceful revolution, that's fine, do this: Vote U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, & U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders 2020!!

Resist: ...Divest. take all money out of your bank. research credit unions, and put it there, if they have nothing ta do with the banks, they are golden..
this accomplishes three things.

1.): repube candidates don't get some of the funding they need for their evil campaigns.

2.) :banks lose revenue. which = oil companies who regularly rig our elections & kill our environment, lose loans, grants, and other volumes of money.

an 3.): it ends certain banks that think they are too big to fail. ..they lost billions and trillions of your revenue in 2011, and instead of being punished for it, ..they were rewarded by being saved.

Resist. ..take your money out of big banks that help oil corporations fund trumpets, an repube campaigns. put that money into a localized credit union, and research them. as long as they have nothing ta do with the big banks, then they are good. take advantage of state an federal tax credits, an use solar, wind, tidal, and geo-thermal.
boycott oil and gas. boycott regular oil based plastics.
buy from non petroleum based plastics companies, that are factually making everything we use, like car parts, cell phones, even simulated paper stock. no oil is used. no trees are harmed. ----boycott what makes their economy work. that's the only ""peaceful"" way to silence them.

Your perspective and analysis are very much important to resolve the conflict and restore peace and stability in Arakan/Rakhine, Myanmar. Analysis is very important to give your right perspectives and suggestion; real information is vital. 
Bengali(so-called Rohingya) terrorist who lost in military attack try to get political benefit and to misunderstand Myanmar among the international communities. So, Bengali terrorists are taking a wave of propaganda operation in Bengali Muslim communities in order to Bengali Muslims get fear and flee from their villages for safety. 
Bengali people flee for Bangladesh due to propaganda which says, “you will be killed when Burmese soldier come.” This word is spreading all the time in Muslims communities and makes them fear.
Empty villages are set fire everyday by Bengali terrorist after Bengali people ran away for their safety. Then took video burning homes and villages, and they upload burning houses and villages videos in different social websites such as facebook, twitter and so on by mentioning Burmese troops and local Rakhine people set villages fire. Bengali terrorists are lying the world. Some media also supporting the terrorist so that media doesn’t give the right information to the international communities. Resulting of this bias and propaganda, Rakhine people and Myanmar have been seen extremist, aggressive people by the world.
Imagine that how Rakhine people could set villages fire while they are fleeing away for their safety. Very few people sheltering in Maung Daw and Buthidaung Townships but villages in rural are empty. How they can set villages fire?

It remains a educational bargain too many fail to take advantage of. One of the most satisfying days of my life was the day the last loan was paid off.

There are some bizarre choices available that basically are unemployable so there is no chance that the loans could ever be repaid. I was surprised at the folks our age still with school loans. Those that went back to school later in life and haven't earned enough to repay is sad. And those that took out loans for their kids baffles me. No where did it say that the children were even helping to pay back the money that sponsored their education. Entitlement generation.",Joe Serflek,2017-10-15 12:06:25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

She realized she should have asked more questions, and now the son has a better job so is hoping to take the monkey off of his mother's back. What really galls me however is that these loans are never forgiven, can never be renegotiated to lower rates, yet mortgages can be defaulted on or renegotiated. These young people contribute to our nation's future, but if they cannot fully participate in the economy by making major purchases which in generations past (like ours) then that pulls everything down. This is a very profound problem which affects us all. Along the same lines, we faculty at MUSOD park in same lot with students. There are quite a number of them who drive expensive and relatively new vehicles, and I assume are also carrying huge school debt. Seems to be rediculous to me, but what do I know.

 *******History lesson!************
When United States Navy warship “Gloucester” pulled into Guánica Bay in the early morning hours of July 25, 1898, Puerto Rico became our responsibility. When the disembarking sailors lowered the Spanish flag from the port flagpole and hoisted the American flag, Puerto Rico became our responsibility.
When the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in 1914 to be free of US rule and the US Congress refused to recognize their independence, Puerto Rico was our responsibility.
When the US Congress passed the Jones-Shafroth Act on March 2, 1917 declaring all Puerto Ricans born after April 10, 1899 to be full-fledged US citizens, Puerto Rico was our responsibility. Did you catch that? In 1917, the year the law was passed, people born in 1899 would be turning 18 – legal draft age. The law was passed on March 2, 1917. The US entered WWI on April 6, 1917.
When we gave this grant of citizenship in 1917 over the UNANIMOUS objection of all representatives in the Puerto Rican House of Delegates who believed the grant of citizenship was primarily for the purpose of drafting Puerto Rican men into military service, Puerto Rico was our responsibility.
When Section 1402 of Title 8 of the U.S. Code was amended in 1952 to declare that all Puerto Ricans born after January 13, 1941 are NATURAL BORN American citizens, Puerto Rico was our responsibility.
When the Republican Congress passed – and Bill Clinton signed – legislation in 1996 beginning a ten-year phase-out of FDR New Deal tax incentives for US corporations to create tax-free earnings through subsidiaries operating in Puerto Rico, the failure of the economy of Puerto Rico became our responsibility.
When the consequent ten-year mass exodus of US companies and jobs was complete in 2005 and the economy of Puerto Rico began contracting, the financial plight of Puerto Rico became our responsibility.
When the US Congress made all interest on municipal bonds issued by Puerto Rico free of federal, state, and local taxes, causing Wall Street fund managers to pour loaned-money into the Puerto Rican government like water pouring over the broken levees of Lake Pontchartrain, the debt of Puerto Rico became our responsibility.

President John F. Kennedy: “I speak of peace because of the new face of war. Total war makes no sense in an age when great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces. It makes no sense in an age when a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the Second World War. It makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn.” President John F. Kennedy. 

President John F. Kennedy: “…it is also a warning--a warning to the American people not to fall into the same trap …….. not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats.” President John F. Kennedy

“We prefer world law, in the age of self-determination, to world war in the age of mass extermination.” – John F. Kennedy.

Ironically, As The Republican Fourth Reich of Antichrists worship the Child Rapist, Self Admitted Serial Sexual Predator, Adulter, Father of Lies,Traitor, Tax Evader, Who has attacked Gold Star Families, War Heroes, Allies,  Cross burning enemy of Christ, Cheater, Conman in OUR WHITE HOUSE! 
Here's a little food for thought. There's a difference between a good leader, and a cult leader, and the differences 
are pretty stark. The good leader talks about what the people can do under his, or her, leadership. The cult 
leader talks only about what he, or she can do. Example, the good leader says, ""yes WE can"" the cult leader 
says, ""Only I can fix it""! The cult leader desires to be worshiped, idolized, deified. 

Therefore the cult leader is constantly promoting himself, constantly reminding his subjects of how wonderful 
he is, and how fortunate they are to have him, or her. The good leader only desires what's best for the people, 
he constantly reminds them of what they can do when they work together, he constantly reassures them of how 
great they are, and how strong they are. 

The cult leader isn't interested in a highly educated constituency, because educated people are a threat 
to his rule, the less educated his subjects are, the better for the cult leader. The cult leader isn't interested in 
innovation, nor new industry to solve old problems. ""I love the poorly educated!"" Ring any bells? 

The good leader pushes education, embraces science, and research. He is always pushing for better solutions 
to solve problems, he encourages innovation. The cult leader demands total loyalty and subjection from his 
worshippers, but will not provide the same. The good leader only desires loyalty to the body, to the 
whole, not to himself.",Stephanie Green,2017-10-14 11:37:42,12,9,2,0,0,1,0,0

More precisely, the US adopts a differential strategy: it acts as if it continues to trust the MAD logic in its relations with Russia and China, while it is tempted to practise NUTS with Iran and North Korea.

The paradoxical mechanism of MAD inverts the logic of the ‘self-realizing prophecy’ into a ‘self-stultifying intention’: the very fact that each side can be sure that, should it decide to launch a nuclear attack, the other side will respond with full destructive force, guarantees that no side will start a war. The logic of NUTS is, on the contrary, that the enemy can be forced to disarm if it is assured that we can strike at them without risking a counter-attack. The very fact that two directly contradictory strategies are mobilized simultaneously by the same superpower bears witness to the fantasmatic character of this entire reasoning.""

And ""immediately after the training"" isn't saying much at all for the veracity of the app. I probably show zero implicit racial bias immediately upon waking up, but by god I'm sure I will before I go to bed later that night. As it relates to the overarching issues, I think that we are most open to establish habits and form subjective beliefs in our childhood years. Close minded, prejudiced parents tend to produce close-minded prejudiced kids, not due to some specific genotype, but due to the information learned by those kids from those parents. So yeah, getting folks to do better with their kids as it relates to racial prejudice, thats a good thing.

The Iranian agreement has helped the Ayatollah and his Islamic Revolutionary Guard more entrenched in power because of removal of Economic Sanctions crushing Iran’s Economy and Currency. The Iran Agreement increases funding to Syria’s Assad, the Lebanese Militia Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels in Yemen, and make Israel life miserable with support for Hamas. The Iranian Regime has continued to Test Fire Ballistic Missiles with “Death to Israel” painted on the side. President Obama’s and Secretary John Kerry’s Idealistic Thinking that the more Moderate Forces will emerge from the Iranian Theocracy is delusional in the increased control the Ayatollah has with improved Economic Conditions and locking up his Political Opponents. Russia has agreed to build ten Nuclear Power Plants in Iran providing plenty of cover to make Enriched Uranium Bomb Making Grades with thousands of Centrifuges running. The Agreement guarantees Iran will have Nuclear Weapons in ten years or less. Iran has been arresting Foreign Nationals trying to return to Iran to send a message that the Ayatollah’s Tyranny will continue. I think it is almost Treason that president Obama and John Kerry agreed to the Iranian Agreement.

Other Secret Exemptions deal with Heavy Water Production, Low Grade Uranium Stockpile, and Missile Launches. The Iranian Agreement negotiated by President Obama and Secretary John Kerry is total garbage with the Secret Side Agreements hidden from the American Public.

This is the ""dog that didn't bark"" - the absence of any leaks of actual evidence tells me that there simply is no such evidence.

This entire farce is apparently based on the ""dossier"" created by Michael Steele.  Which is a blatantly false piece of propaganda put out solely to hurt Trump.  This ""dossier"" circulated for months, and nobody - not even The New York Times - would publish it because it was so riddled with easily proven falsehoods.

But James Comey briefed Trump on the existence of this dossier.  Why?  To give Trump a  heads up?  No....so that it could then be leaked that the FBI had briefed Trump on the existence of the dossier....which gave the corrupt liberal media the excuse they needed to publish and talk about as if it was anything other than what it is - a bunch of lies assembled to make Trump look bad.

What really cracks me up is that almost a year after the election Democrats are still firmly stuck in the ""Denial"" stage of the grieving process.  Which is fine with me....because if brain-dead liberals refuse to acknowledge why Hillary Clinton lost they cannot possibly make the necessary changes required to win future elections.

So keep telling yourself that Trump colluded with Russia and that Bob Mueller is going to save the day and issue a report leading to the impeachment of President Trump.

Good luck with that strategy.",Carl Fales,2017-10-14 11:05:41,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Well, we had a bus driver who not only sang the praises of Puerto Rico, but spoke to us about being grateful for our lives.  He said every morning he wakes up and thanks God for his life, and every night before he goes to sleep he thanks God for his life.  He was so inspiring and joyful, that he literally lit up the whole bus of tired cruise ship passengers and had most of us singing with him by the end of the ride!  My friend and I were at the very back of the bus, so we were nearly the last ones to leave. I was so anxious to thank this wonderful, loving man for such a joyful journey to the airport. When we left the bus he was standing there thanking everyone for coming to his beloved Puerto Rico, and then I noticed that his face had some type of deformity that was probably from birth---here in front of me was someone who, despite what he was dealt in life, not only spent his time lifting others up but also expressing his gratitude to God several times a day!!

People who could trace back the origin of the photos discovered that they are inauthentic.
When the ambassador of Turkey to Myanmar was called in to explain the matter there appeared a tweet admitting the inauthenticity of the said post which was later deleted.
Likewise, AFP has to change its photos after confessing to using wrong ones in releasing Rakhine region news.
Although the confessions were made about the false information and images, they have already damaged the image of the Burma government, the security forces, and the people.

The mainstream media and UN interviews in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh conducted with Bengali Rohingya refugees are largely fake and exaggerated. None of the news portals report facts, just fictional accounts.
Usually, the Bengali Rohingya terrorists and the Bengali Rohingya Right group coach Bengali Rohingya refugees to lie, to cry when media and UN interviewing.

The stories of rape, torching Bengali Rohingya's villages, extrajudicial killings and ‘GENOCIDE', ETHNIC CLEANSING' against the Bengali (‘Rohingya’) are mass-transmitted and in no way are they fabricated unless the entire population in addition to all media outlets and human-rights organizations have conspired together.

The problem was created by the British colonial government by importing cheap Bengali laborers from current India (location Bangladesh) in World War Two. 
Since then The Bengali Rohingya have moved to Burma from Bangladesh illegally and then began to behave as Muslim barbarians always do.As always, Islam aims to expand, seize, and conquer.
The Bengali( Rohingya) have been terrorists and there has been the element of ‘Islamization’ going on, in Rakhine since 1942.

The statement that ""Rohingya"" become terrorists because of long oppression and discrimination against Rohingya is wrong as ""Rohingya"" has been already terrorists before Burma military regime born in Burma.

THERE ARE MANY MISUSE of the word ‘GENOCIDE’ these days.
The so-called Rohingya Right Groups and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights frequently accuse the Burma Gov of ‘GENOCIDE', “SLOW BURNING GENOCIDE’, SYSTEMATIC KILLING"" AND ‘ETHNIC CLEANSING’, “a textbook example of ethnic cleansing” against the Bengali (‘Rohingya’) Muslims.
That is not even close to being a situation that can use the term ‘Genocide’.
The only true genocide in Burma was the 1942 Maungdaw Genocide – where Bengali Muslims V-Force (the term ‘Rohingya’ was unknown then) armed by the British to fight the Japanese in WWII did not fight the Japanese,
but instead, turned the weapons on the dominant, indigenous Rakhine Buddhist Culture, killing 30,000 Rakhine Buddhists in Maungdaw township alone, burned over 400 Buddhist villages, and sent 100,000 Buddhists fleeing for their lives.
The so-called Rohingya Rights Groups attempt to cover their exaggerated and manipulative accusations against the Rakhine Buddhists in western Burma, with the inflammatory charge of: ‘genocide against the Rohingya Muslims’.
In reality, the Rakhine Buddhist people, their culture, and their Buddhism are facing the silent genocide in Rakhine State, western Burma.

Main victims are native Rakhine people. Day by day the innocent Rakhine Buddhists are hacked to death by Bengali Rohingya ARSA terrorist.

The corrupt media have been busy, as usual, to portray Bengali Rohingya and Bengali Rohingya ARSA terrorists in Burma as “innocent victims”,""stateless Rohingya"",""long oppressed minority"", who have been “living in this Rakhine state for centuries”. This is total rubbish. 
Now The Bengali Rohingya terrorists are playing the victimhood card as usual and Muslims all over the world are joining in the chorus of anti-Buddhist and anti-Myanmar demonstrations.

The root of the problem is Bangladesh’s overpopulation fueled by lack of birth control. Bangladesh is the real culprit and is encouraging its surplus population to flood the neighboring countries including Myanmar.
 Myanmar is only a scapegoat. Instead, the attention and international pressure should be directed to the Bangladeshi government.

Just to name a few, my Grandfather is a decorated war vet from WWII.  My father fought in Vietnam, My husband served at the end of Vietnam.  Many of my Cousins, Uncles, and in-laws also served.  None of them served the flag or the anthem.  They served the people of the United States, they served to protect ALL of our Freedoms, not just the ones YOU think people should have.  They served the Constitution of the United States of America.  They served for your right to spout ignorance because to look at the truth is uncomfortable for you.  They served so that any one of us could peacefully protest.   When people protest in a park, people like you start complaining it is not right because YOU can't use the park.  When people protest on a bridge, people like you complain because YOU might have had to drive a different way.  When people protest on the sidewalk, people like YOU complain that it inconveniences YOU.  YOU YOU YOU...it is all about YOU and your beliefs and screw anyone and their rights as long as YOU get what YOU want.  Yet, you sit here complaining about a peaceful protest that in no way interferes with the football game that people pay to see.  See, to interfere, they would have to actually stop the football game and protest ON the field.

""SO (emphasis mine) he was expected to act like a black man....""

To answer your question (which included no actual question mark but I'm assuming it was) there are other scenarios:

1. He could be accepted as an intelligent black man who came from the ghetto. Those DO exist.

2. He could be an intelligent black man who never even visited a ghetto. Those  ALSO exist.

3. Either way, making him colorless to assuage any ill-conceived notions of what it is to be black undermines his personhood and detracts from identity.

Please be advised that black and ghetto derived are not synonymous, and being from the ghetto is not exclusive of education.

I can't speak to your intent, but the construct of your comment could be perceived as offensive and myopic.

As for the acting white part, I hope no one is that misguided. I've met white uneducated fools that live in the ghetto and I've met black educated fools that live in the suburbs.

I spent most of my adult life as a nurse. I’ve seen some people on pain meds normally used for terminal cancer patients being used for minor pain. I’ve known people who have taken extra doses of pain meds to get high, instead of following the directions. Just blaming the drugs isn’t the answer.
For surgery or injury, a short term use of pain medication can ease pain and enhance recover. There are many people who have chronic pain that desperately need relief. Most are not addicted to their medications and would love to not need them. Im a retired nurse. I have Vicodin ES and Soma. I have sever back pain, arthritis and muscle spasms. Some days I just take Advil or Tylenol, others I take the Vicodin and Soma. Sometimes I have several good days and might not take a pain pill for a week. Sometime I hurt so bad that I might blow my brains out if I didn’t have something to give me relief. The Vicodin and Soma do not completely stop the pain, but they ease it down to a tolerable level. I do not take more than what is prescribed. I’ve yet to feel less anxiety, calmer, euphoric or high from my pain meds. 
I worked as a nurse most of my adult life. I’ve never seen a person get addicted to pain medication that was properly prescribed and that was taken properly by the patient. I have seen people abuse pain medication, by taking it too often or using too much, and getting addicted. I’m not going to say a person couldn’t get addicted to pain meds while using them properly, but it isn’t a common issue.",Joey Orr,2017-10-13 22:04:39,10,7,3,0,0,0,0,0

“In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,” Trump said Friday in a speech from the White House. “It is under continuous review, and our participation can be canceled by me, as president, at any time.”

Under the 2015 JCPOA, negotiated between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries, Iran has significantly scaled back its nuclear program and allowed broad access to international inspectors in exchange for sanctions relief from the international community. Some of the restrictions on the number of centrifuges Iran can have spinning and the amount of uranium it can enrich will expire between 10 and 15 years from when the agreement was implemented.

Trump’s preference, he said Friday, is for Congress to revise an existing U.S. law in a way that makes those restrictions on Iran’s nuclear program permanent. The revised law would also reimpose sanctions that were lifted under the nuclear accord if Iran takes certain steps related to its ballistic missile program, Trump said.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) have already started drafting such legislation, working in coordination with the White House. It is unclear whether the envisioned legislation would have the votes to pass.

Democrats, including some who voted against implementing the deal in 2015, so far have lined up against the proposal.

Rep. Eliot Engel (N.Y.), the ranking Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, slammed Trump’s Iran plan as an unrealistic attempt to unilaterally change the terms of an international agreement.

“The President’s plan doesn’t make sense. Negotiating additional terms to the nuclear deal requires a coalition of international partners, not unilateral congressional action,” Engel, who opposed the deal in 2015, said in a statement.

“I strongly disagree with the President’s reckless, political decision and his subsequent threat to Congress. At a moment when the United States and its allies face a nuclear crisis with North Korea, the President has manufactured a new crisis that will isolate us from our allies and partners, compromising our ability to employ a diplomatic surge on the Korean Peninsula,” said Rep. Ben Cardin (Md.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who also previously opposed the Iran deal.

Calling on lawmakers to redefine the Iran deal, Cardin said, is reminiscent of how Trump handled immigration and health care policies. The president “is abdicating his leadership role to Congress, just like with Dreamers and just like with affirming and strengthening our health care system. It is a troubling pattern. We will not buy into the false premise that it is Congress’ role to legislate solutions to problems of his own making,” Cardin’s statement continued.

The key criticism against the Trump administration’s proposal is that it rests on the assumption the U.S. can unilaterally change its obligations under an international agreement without facing major blowback from Iran or any of the other countries who helped negotiate the deal.

Iran’s Foreign Ministry warned that it would consider the nuclear agreement null if it stops receiving the benefits it was guaranteed under the 2015 agreement. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will not be the first to withdraw from the deal, but if its rights and interests in the deal are not respected, it will stop implementing all its commitments and will resume its peaceful nuclear program without any restrictions,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.

“The President’s gambit is irresponsible and dangerous,” Daryl G. Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, wrote in a statement. “Any attempt by the White House or Congress to unilaterally change the terms of the highly-successful nuclear deal with Iran risks setting Washington on a course to violate the deal.”

Trump’s speech follows a lengthy interagency review and months of speculation about whether he would scrap the nuclear deal or toss the decision to Congress. Throughout the review, Trump reportedly pressured his aides to come up with a way to leave the Iran deal ― even as members of his Cabinet recommended remaining party to the agreement.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis testified earlier this month that abiding by the agreement is consistent with U.S. national security interests. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson explicitly told reporters on Thursday, hours before Trump threatened to terminate the agreement, that the administration planned to remain in it.

The administration’s plan, previewed by Tillerson on Thursday, appeared to be a delicately crafted effort by Trump’s advisers to give him the chance to deliver a tough-sounding speech on Iran while tossing to Congress the consequential part of the decision about the nuclear accord’s future. Tillerson did not indicate on Thursday any plans for Trump to threaten to scuttle the agreement if he didn’t get his way with lawmakers. 

Trump also appeared to go beyond what Tillerson had previewed on Thursday when he announced his decision to authorize the Treasury Department to sanction “the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps for its support for terrorism.”

Tillerson said Thursday the administration would sanction IRGC-linked individuals and entities but would avoid sanctioning the entire military group because of potential complications if U.S. troops encounter IRGC troops on the battlefield.

After months of waiving sanctions against Iran and certifying its compliance, Trump appeared to relish the opportunity to rail against what he described as a murderous “Iranian dictatorship.” 

He spent the first several minutes of his speech listing various grievances against the Iranian regime: the Iran hostage crisis that began in 1979, the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut, and Iran’s support for various terrorist groups that threaten the U.S. 

Trump accused Iran of committing “multiple violations” of the nuclear agreement ― hours after Tillerson acknowledged Iran is “under technical compliance” with the terms of the JCPOA. The apparent violations Trump referred to have been described by experts as “minor infraction[s]” that were quickly rectified. The International Atomic Energy Agency, tasked with monitoring the use of nuclear energy, has now confirmed Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal eight times.

Despite having the entire U.S. intelligence community at his disposal, Trump relied on vague assertions of Iranian wrongdoing to build his case. 

“There are also many people who believe that Iran is dealing with North Korea,” Trump said Friday, adding that he would direct the intelligence community to do a “thorough analysis” of the issue.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who led the U.S. negotiating team throughout the Iran deal talks, accused Trump of “creating an international crisis” and urged lawmakers to act as a bulwark against the president’s plan. 

“President Trump’s decision today is dangerous,” Kerry said in a statement. “It’s a reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology from a President who would rather play a high-stakes game of chicken with Congress and with Iran than admit that the nuclear agreement is working.”

If the average Social Security 2% increase is $25, the Medicare Part B premium cannot be raised any higher than that amount. This should not be a problem for those currently paying the 2017 Part B premium of $134 a month. Early guidance from Medicare indicates an expectation for that premium rate to be stable into 2018. However, for those still paying $109 because of the hold harmless rule and lack of Social Security increases in the past, they may see more of their $25 go for a Part B increase. Unless you are not yet taking your Social Security but are on Medicare, or are not deducting your Part B from your Social Security check, or are in one of the higher income categories (earning more than $85,000 a year if filing single or $170,000 a year if filing joint returns.)

Yes, we need someone(s) who can unite us and resolve things, but Trump?  No.

The Court held, in a 6-to-3 decision delivered by Justice Jackson, that it was unconstitutional for public schools to compel students to salute the flag. It thus overruled its decision in Minersville School District v. Gobitis, finding that the flag salute was ""a form of utterance"" and ""a primitive but effective means of communicating ideas."" ""Compulsory unification of opinion,"" the Court wrote, was doomed to failure and was antithetical to the values set forth in the First Amendment. The Court eloquently stated: ""If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.""

There are resources, but there are not tremendous resources. They are quite limited, and they are (pending) major cuts and many have guidelines that disqualify a huge amount of those in need. I have been working in a homeless shelter for the last 5 years, including doing the books. Look into how many shelters of any kind keep the family together as a unit. Allows a father with daughters keep his girls with him during crisis. How many women with boys over age 12 are allowed in the women's shelters. Yes there are some resources, some funding but no where near what is needed and most is private donations. As an example from one chapter: of over $777k only $76k was provided by grants and not all of them were federal or state grants, again most were private from civics groups etc. the need is great the funding is minimal and if a film raises awareness from one additional person to either donate or volunteer, it is worth it. 
All of this information is available online. 990's are available. Point in time counts are available, federal and state budgets, designations, and proposed cuts are all available.

My point was that this issue is not so simplistic as to claim “poor Rohingyas” when there are thousands of Buddhist burmese families that have been victimized by the squatters.

I have no problem with individual states adopting and implementing a type of universal healthcare program; but have issues with the Federal govt creating one. One could make the argument that if health care is a right and people therefore should not be denied access, then through the 2nd Amendment, I should be able to have my guns (arms) given to me by the Federal govt, paid for by John & Jane Taxpayer. I also am against paying for someone's healthcare if the condition they are in is self-inflicted -- heart disease, diabetes, etc. as a result of poor diet and lack of exercise; or they blew off their fingers lighting off fireworks.

As long as it is a for-profit business, it is going to have to be paid for, and basic economic truths tell us the majority of that is going to rest on the middle class, at least in terms of percentage of income, which limits their spending power, which in turn degrades our country's economic health.  I understand the urge for a strict interpretation of the Constitution, but I fear that does a disservice to the Constitution itself, the country it is intended to guide and to humanity in general.  And I know you understand the need for the evolution of our governing documents, or you'd have more to say about the 3/5s compromise and every amendment added after initial ratification.  

As an aside:  You imply here that you'd be fine paying for other people's healthcare as long as they allowed you (or someone else) to legislate their diet and exercise regimen?  That doesn't seem very Libertarian of you.",Erin Lee Damron,2017-10-14 13:05:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While oxy overprescription has been an issue in the south and some HMOs and PPOs are using pain control prescriptions to supplant real care, the use of opioids in general, is effective and has been for a thousand years.

We've known about addiction for hundreds of years.  The events as of late lie with the illegal use of fentanyl and oxy.  It has been irresponsible to blame the use of all opioids to be an epidemic.  This has only proven to harm those with real chronic disabling pain to be denied much needed medication and has only made the lives of those already in real pain, far more unbearable.

At a time when the GOP is destroying the healthcare of an entire nation for personal profits, going after all opioids just adds to their responsibility.

This is only one of a handful of stories I've seen separating out the illegal use of fentanyl from overall opioid use. 

And it is the illegal use of synthetic opioids that is killing Americans.  Regulated forms of opioids have the same percentage rate of accidental death as it did twenty years ago.  It's only because the illegal use has been lumped into the same group as other opioid use that has skewed these figures to falsely reflect All opioids as being a runaway epidemic of illegal use and overdose.",Rob Byrne,2017-10-12 17:39:08,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

1.)	President Obama signed the Paris Climate Agreement in September 2016 using Executive Order and bypassing the normal Congressional Treaty Approval Process – Unconstitutional Action.
2.)	The U.S. has reduced CO2 faster than Europe due to low cost Natural Gas Fracking coupled to the reduction of Coal usage.
3.)	Germany has been the world’s leader in Renewable Energy to generate electricity with 30% Renewable Energy installed. The cost effect on German Industry and Consumers is Average German Electric Rates are three times what the U.S. Electricity Rates are and CO2 Emissions are increasing in Germany as Coal Consumption is increasing due to unreliable Renewable Energy Production. Coal Electrical Generation is needed for Backup Power Grid Electrical Demand.
4.)	Coal Generating Plants will continue to be commissioned in China and India to meet increasing Electrical Demand and the Paris Climate Agreement does not call for limits on Coal Consumption for India and China until 2030.
5.)	The U.S. Paris Climate Agreement calls for drastic 26% to 28% CO2 Reduction by 2025, which is insane relative to increasing Coal Consumption throughout the world to at least to 2030. The Radical Obama Administration Clean Power Plan would only meet 45% of 2025 Paris Climate Agreement U.S. Goals and would require very radical additional U.S. Regulations trashing the U.S. Economy.
6.)	The Sierra Club and other Leftist Environmental Groups would bring Lawsuits under the International Air Pollution provisions under the Clean Air Act to enforce the Voluntary Goals of the Paris Climate Agreement – a giant future risk to the U.S. Economy.
7.)	The biggest “Con” of the Paris Climate Agreement is if all the provisions were met by all participating countries by the year 2100 (very doubtful), the effect on Global Warming would be only .17 C and an insignificant effect on planet earth.

It is a symbolic gesture to the Left's Man-Made Climate Change Religious Disciples and will have an insignificant effect compared to rising coal consumption around the world. Little Ice Ages took place between 1300 and 1500 and again between 1600 and 1750 and is thought to be attributed to Solar Activity. The Climate has been gradually warming and the Scientific Question of Today is Man-Made CO2 the Primary Factor of Secondary Factor causing Climate Warming and has not been proven and the last twenty years have seen very little Climate Warming. The Chinese have made President Obama look like a fool – the Chinese underreported their Coal usage by 17% - a horrendously large number equal to a total of 5.5 billion tons instead of 4.7 billion tons annually and while the U.S. uses approximately .8 billion tons annually. The Obama Climate Negotiations with the Chinese are a joke before they lied – pure political fog and symbolism. The article from Reuters “China approves Massive New Coal Capacity Despite Pollution Fears” says China has approved coal mine expansion of another 100 million tons in 2013 and planning to increase coal production 2% to 3% annual increase over the next five years. The Coal Mines that produce less than 1.2 million tons annually capacity only need local government approval so the expansion is considerably larger. According to U.S. Government projections, China plans to commission a new 600 Megawatt coal fired power plant every 10 days for the next 10 years or 363 plants. India plans 455 new coal fired power plants and Pakistan just signed construction contracts with China for a dozen new coal fired power plants. China has slowed down lately the construction of Coal Fired Power Plants because their economy has slowed and Electricity demand has slowed.  The U.S. “War on Coal” is the Obama Administration efforts to please its radical green base of voters – pure political symbolism. The agreement with China to limit fossil fuel use by 2030 is really humorous with the 40 to 50 year lifespan infrastructure investments they are presently making. The Chinese tradition is to negotiate contracts after contract is signed – I think they think their 2030 obligation about CO2 emissions if pretty funny. http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/07/china-coal-idUSL3N0K90H720140107",Douglas Lee,2017-10-12 19:36:24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think regardless of the fact that addicts exist, opioids should not ever be 'easy' to gain access to. They're not hard to get *because* addicts exist; they're hard to get because they're highly addictive by their very nature. I can promise you no one chooses to be an addict; no one goes and decides they want to be drug addicted. It is a process that starts somewhere, and that somewhere can easily be the pharmacists counter. You do know that marijuana works better for pain than any dangerous opioid? Of course I am sure you don't advocate for that. Opioids can kill you, they're literally like poison to your body, and they can make you an (unintentional) addict real quick. Yet, of course marijuana is a schedule 1 drug while fentanyl is a tier down. Our society is so backwards, and you fall right for it. Prison does not and will not solve addiction problems. Prison more often than not creates real criminals when addicts come out. Leave prison for the real evil doers; murderers, rapists, drug DEALERS who are creating the very products that are a problem and harmful to society (NOT USERS).",Haley Wilson,2017-10-15 07:46:25,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

If guns were banned, especially semi auto weapons, this couldn't have happened.

""it. was. a. riot."" if the ones that make the laws are wrong in making them, they aren't going to change those laws they wanted. if the police enforce these laws on we the people, then in that case, nothing can be filed, nothing can actually sway them to change said laws. ..except a riot/new revolution. if you want a peaceful revolution, that's fine, do this: Vote U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, & U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders 2020!!

2.) :banks lose revenue. which = oil companies who regularly rig our elections & kill our environment, lose loans, grants, and other volumes of money.

an 3.): it ends certain banks that think they are too big to fail. ..they lost billions and trillions of your revenue in 2011, and instead of being punished for it, ..they were rewarded by being saved.

Resist. ..take your money out of big banks that help oil corporations fund trumpets, an repube campaigns. put that money into a localized credit union, and research them. as long as they have nothing ta do with the big banks, then they are good. take advantage of state an federal tax credits, an use solar, wind, tidal, and geo-thermal.
boycott oil and gas. boycott regular oil based plastics.

If guns were banned, especially semi auto weapons, this couldn't have happened. Martial arts weaponry with tasers attached, can facilitate the rights to bear arms, without killing people. football players have every right to kneel, an trumpet shouldn't state otherwise. rights granted by our constitution of freedoms of speech an protest, don't stop at the work place. those companies need to realize contracts can't skirt law. the american revolution was not a change of law, filed in a court, and then voted on. ""it. was. a. riot."" if the ones that make the laws are wrong in making them, they aren't going to change those laws they wanted. if the police enforce these laws on we the people, then in that case, nothing can be filed, nothing can actually sway them to change said laws. ..except a riot/new revolution. if you want a peaceful revolution, that's fine, do this: Vote U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, & U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders 2020!!

Resist: ...Divest. take all money out of your bank. research credit unions, and put it there, if they have nothing ta do with the banks, they are golden..
this accomplishes three things.

1.): repube candidates don't get some of the funding they need for their evil campaigns.

2.) :banks lose revenue. which = oil companies who regularly rig our elections & kill our environment, lose loans, grants, and other volumes of money.

an 3.): it ends certain banks that think they are too big to fail. ..they lost billions and trillions of your revenue in 2011, and instead of being punished for it, ..they were rewarded by being saved.

Resist. ..take your money out of big banks that help oil corporations fund trumpets, an repube campaigns. put that money into a localized credit union, and research them. as long as they have nothing ta do with the big banks, then they are good. take advantage of state an federal tax credits, an use solar, wind, tidal, and geo-thermal.
boycott oil and gas. boycott regular oil based plastics.
buy from non petroleum based plastics companies, that are factually making everything we use, like car parts, cell phones, even simulated paper stock. no oil is used. no trees are harmed. ----boycott what makes their economy work. that's the only ""peaceful"" way to silence them.

If President Trump proceeds with decertification of the Iran nuclear deal it underscores his cowardice at two levels. At the more general level it captures his fruitless attempt to impose a 19th century view of the United States separated from the rest of the world by the oceans. It reflects his view that global security is unimportant, that an isolated America is more secure than an engaged one. Both folly and cowardice. On a specific level it demonstrates how much he fears the ""other"" whether that refers to Iranians, Mexicans, Muslims, blacks, or anyone else without the resources to buy their way into Mar-a-Lago. Here he decertifies but cannot take the responsibility for breaking the deal.....that he leaves to Congress. He condemns football players but sends Mike Pence to walk out on the game. He demands the end of Obamacare but sits in the White House, hoping Congress bears the burden. We see a long history of Trump seeking to escape responsibility because he does not have the moral fortitude to lead and take risk, preferring to hide on the golf course or behind locked doors or pre-screened crowds so he does not have to face challenge. Of course he is Putin's poodle because he sees Putin as tough where as immigrants are generally powerless. The grand irony is that with Iran he adopts the demeanor but runs from the ayatollahs. A real president would go to Teheran to hammer out a deal; Donald Trump hides behind Lindsay Graham and Mario Rubio to make the break he cannot.
If Trump walks away, he will lose every ally and trade partners will walk away. And rightly so.",Marlene Autio-Horne,2017-10-11 19:29:25,6,6,0,0,0,0,0,0

Netanyahu caught on tape in 2001: 'Don't worry about the Americans, we easily maneuver them' - 'This is how I deliberately sabotaged the Oslo Accords' - 'We plan to strike Palestinians several times, so hard the pain will be unbearable'

Netanyahu: Today everyone understands the slogan 'The Settlements are here'. They are everywhere. What's the difference? What do you think [Palestinian leader Yassir] Arafat wants? He wants one big settlement that is called Tel Aviv. As far as they are concerned, I think, the territorial waters are also theirs [Palestinians']. That they want us to be pushed into the sea is obvious, but only further away... 

The main thing is, first of all, to strike them, not once but several times, so painfully that the price they pay will be unbearable. So far, the price-tag is not unbearable. [I mean] a large-scale attack on the Palestinian Authority, causing them to fear that everything is about to collapse. Fear is what brings them to... 

Host: Hold on, then 'the world' will again say that we're aggressors. 

Netanyahu: They can say whatever they want. 

Host: Aren't you afraid of what they'll say? 

Netanyahu: No. 

Host: Especially today with the U.S. I know how they are... 

Netanyahu: America is something that you can easily maneuver and move in the right direction. And even if they do say something, so then they say something... so what? 80% of Americans support us! It's absurd! We have such support there, and here we're thinking 'what should we do if?'... 

Look, I wasn't afraid to maneuver [the Clinton Administration]. I wasn't afraid to confront Clinton. I wasn't afraid to go against the U.N. What happened with the Oslo Accords? The Accords, which were ratified by Parliament. I was asked before the [1996] elections: ""Will you fulfil them?"" 

I said: ""Yes, subject to reciprocity, and minimizing pull-outs."" But how can one minimize the [obliged] pull-outs? I gave my own interpretation to the agreements, in such a way that will allow me to stop the race back to the 1967 borders. 

Host: How did we manage to do this? 

Netanyahu: Nobody defined what ""Military Facilities"" are. So I also defined them as being 'security zones'. The entire Jordan Valley, for me, is a ""military facility"". Nobody has... 

Host: Yes. Like the Beit She'an valley. 

Netanyahu: You see, go figure. But then there was the question of who will define these ""military facilities""? I received a letter from [Secretary of State, Warren] Christopher, sent to me and to Arafat at the same time, saying that Israel and Israel alone will define the ""military facilities"", their locations, and size. 

Now, they didn't want to give this letter so I refused to sign the Hebron Accords [of 1997]. I stopped the government meeting and I said: ""I won't sign."" And only when the letter arrived, during that meeting, to me and to Arafat, did I sign the Hebron Accords. Or ratified it, to be exact - it was already signed. 

Why is this important? Because at that very moment, in fact, I halted the fulfilment of the Oslo Agreements. 

It's better to give 2% than 100%. This is the choice we're facing. ""You gave 2%, but you stopped the withdrawal, rather than 100%."" The wisdom is not to be there and break, but rather to be there and pay the minimum.

August 6, 2015 6:00 am As congressional Republicans seek to undermine the nuclear agreement between Iran and the international powers, they assert that hardline Islamists in the Islamic Republic are delighted with the deal, while Israelis concerned over their country’s security are appalled. The same theme is now repeated constantly on Fox News Channel and throughout right-wing media.
But that message is largely false – and in very important respects, the opposite is true.
In arguing for the agreement at American University last Wednesday, President Obama noted that the most hostile factions in the Tehran regime aren’t celebrating this agreement – as the cover of the New York Post suggested. “In fact, it’s those hardliners who are most comfortable with the status quo,” he said. “It’s those hardliners chanting ‘Death to America’ who have been most opposed to the deal. They’re making common cause with the Republican caucus.”
Indeed, while vast throngs of Iranians greeted their government’s negotiators in a joyous welcome, the fanatical reactionaries in the Revolutionary Guard and the paramilitary Basij movement – which have violently repressed democratic currents in Iran – could barely control their outrage. Upon reading the terms, a Basij spokesman said last month, “We quickly realized that what we feared…had become a reality. If Iran agrees with this, our nuclear industry will be handcuffed for many years to come.”
Hoping and perhaps praying for a veto by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, their Supreme Leader, the Basijis, the right-wing media in Teheran, and their regime sponsors pointed to “red lines” that the agreement allegedly crossed. “We will never accept it,” said Mohammed Ali Jafari, a high-ranking Revolutionary Guard commander.
Such shrill expressions of frustration should encourage everyone who understands the agreement’s real value. Iran’s “Death to America, Death to Israel” cohort hates this deal – not only because of its highly restrictive provisions, but because over the long term, it strengthens their democratic opponents and threatens their corrupt control of Iranian society.
In Israel, meanwhile, the alarmist criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – a sage whose confident predictions about Iran, Iraq, and almost everything else are reliably, totally wrong – has obscured support from actual military and intelligence leaders. Like experts in this country and around the world, the best-informed Israelis understand the deal’s imperfections very well — and support it nevertheless.
“There are no ideal agreements,” declared Ami Ayalon, a military veteran who headed the Israeli Navy and later oversaw the Jewish state’s security service, the Shin Bet. But as Ayalon explained to J.J. Goldberg of the Forward, this agreement is “the best possible alternative from Israel’s point of view, given the other available alternatives” — including the most likely alternative which is, as Obama explained, another extremely dangerous Mideast war.
Efraim Halevy, who formerly ran the Mossad, Israel’s foreign intelligence service, and later headed its National Security Council, concurs with Ayalon (and Obama). Writing in Yedioth Aharonoth, the national daily published in Tel Aviv, Halevy points out a profound contradiction in Netanyahu’s blustering complaints. Having warned that an Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a unique existential threat to Israel, how can Bibi logically reject the agreement that forestalls any bomb development for at least 15 years and increases the “breakout time” from one month to a year — even if Iran ultimately violates its commitments?
Such a deal is far preferable to no deal, the ex-Mossad chief insists, although it won’t necessarily dissuade Tehran from making trouble elsewhere. Halevy also emphasizes that no mythical “better” deal would ever win support from Russia and China, Iran’s main weapons suppliers, whose leaders have endorsed this agreement.
In short, both of these top former officials believe the agreement with Iran will enhance their nation’s security – and contrary to what Fox News Channel’s sages might claim, they represent mainstream opinion in Israel’s military and intelligence circles.
So perhaps we can safely discount the partisan demagogues and feckless opportunists who claim to be protecting the Jewish state from Barack Obama. And when someone like Mike Huckabee – who memorably escaped military service because of his “flat feet” – denounces the president for “marching Israelis to the oven door,” let’s remember the sane and serious response of Israel’s most experienced defenders.

More precisely, the US adopts a differential strategy: it acts as if it continues to trust the MAD logic in its relations with Russia and China, while it is tempted to practise NUTS with Iran and North Korea.

The paradoxical mechanism of MAD inverts the logic of the ‘self-realizing prophecy’ into a ‘self-stultifying intention’: the very fact that each side can be sure that, should it decide to launch a nuclear attack, the other side will respond with full destructive force, guarantees that no side will start a war. The logic of NUTS is, on the contrary, that the enemy can be forced to disarm if it is assured that we can strike at them without risking a counter-attack. The very fact that two directly contradictory strategies are mobilized simultaneously by the same superpower bears witness to the fantasmatic character of this entire reasoning.""

For terminal patients and for victims of shock it's vital. Many crash survivors, burn victims, gun shot victims  and many others only survived because of the strength of this drug. The addiction overdose stats are truly alarming but they have not published the statistics that are  life saving and essential medicine for terminal patients.

Anyone taking opioids regularly for an extended period of time will develop increased tolerance and physical dependence.  But once off the drugs, most people don’t experience craving for them.  Addicts may or may not be physically dependent, but they are mentally and emotionally dependent on them, and merely taking the drugs away doesn’t address the emotional and mental dependence or the factors that brought that about.",David McClelland,2017-10-11 16:44:32,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s a difference in brain chemistry/components that contribute to a person developing the symptoms of addiction , which is often passed down hereditarily (like many other diseases). Where you were/are able to stop, another person isn’t and they are not necessarily to blame for that. It’s taken quite some time and a considerable amount of research and data for doctors & scientists to arrive at this conclusion. Since they have there has been remarkable progress in the treatment of addicts with great turn arounds. However, the issue remains due to the fact that the individual themselves have to arrive at the conclusion that they indeed have a problem and need to receive help for it. The current crisis our country is facing is reliant on this factor. 

People will try and argue it and say it isn’t a disease til they’re blue in the face. You’ll find these individuals have also not received any further education past high school. Not to say they are dumb but they just don’t know any better and due to that they remain stagnant in their knowledge and cling to biases. Personally, I’d never argue with a mechanic about what’s wrong with a car unless I were maybe a mechanic myself but not everyone is sensibly rational in that manner, which is tough to even witness. I’ve heard/read individuals who are bartenders, in car sales, a roofer, and landscapers try to discredit the findings of reputable doctors/scientists (men and women with PHD’s in their field who have not only the knowledge but also experience). To me, that is the most absurd and ridiculous thing to have ever witnessed but there’s no convincing them otherwise. It’s stubborn ignorance in its highest form and I just wish people would allow themselves the opportunity of learning more about that which they hold such strong opinions of.",Vincent Vega,2017-10-11 23:37:09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

2) Iran will keep all the money from the already released sanctions, will have no reason to negotiate with the Americans again, and be able to run their propaganda at full force about the ""Treacherous Americans"". Our international credibility will be further eroded.

What will NOT happen:
1) Iran will NOT come back to the table with America. They got what they want, the cat is out of the bag, and now we either stick to the deal or let them do anything they want.

Trump's latest public outbursts are only the tip of the iceberg. New reports out of the White House paint a picture of a president who is unravelling and on the brink of breakdown. The situation has reportedly gotten so out of control that:

1) Chief John Kelly and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis have discussed ways to stop Trump should he order a nuclear attack.

2) Kelly has tried to keep Trump focused by intercepting outside phone calls to the White House and restricting access to the Oval Office. This has apparently frustrated Trump, and Kelly could soon be on the way out.

3) Many his of advisors believe he is ""unstable"" and ""unravelling"" quickly.

4) Trump has reportedly told his longtime bodyguard, “I hate everyone in the White House! There are a few exceptions, but I hate them!”

Most importantly, some advisors inside the White House are concerned that Trump has become so unhinged that members of the cabinet could invoke the 25th Amendment to remove him from office. Bannon even raised the possibility with the president directly.

For the good of the country, this madman must be removed from office. If Mattis and others are this concerned about his mental state, they have an obligation to put the safety and security of the country over their loyalty the president.",Daniel Craig,2017-10-11 21:22:54,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0

More precisely, the US adopts a differential strategy: it acts as if it continues to trust the MAD logic in its relations with Russia and China, while it is tempted to practise NUTS with Iran and North Korea.

The paradoxical mechanism of MAD inverts the logic of the ‘self-realizing prophecy’ into a ‘self-stultifying intention’: the very fact that each side can be sure that, should it decide to launch a nuclear attack, the other side will respond with full destructive force, guarantees that no side will start a war. The logic of NUTS is, on the contrary, that the enemy can be forced to disarm if it is assured that we can strike at them without risking a counter-attack. The very fact that two directly contradictory strategies are mobilized simultaneously by the same superpower bears witness to the fantasmatic character of this entire reasoning.""

Opioids are designed to be addictive. They hijack your brain. 
Pain is not a mental problem. 
People are denied the opportunity to benefit from other modalities simply because insurance companies refuse more than 9 visits a year, apparently due to the fact that lobbyists have more control than patients over their own care. 
If you want to get people off the opioids, they need to be weened off and managed until the process is complete. Not just told no more pills. Too bad. 
If that means in patient fine. If it means they are able to live normally as the dose is decreased great.
If someone had a prescription, they are, or were, in pain, not mentally ill, or addicted because they're somehow too weak to resist it.

Look. Let me make it easy.
Get the insurance companies to fully cover physical therapy modalities and protocols. Have them cover massage therapy options without hesitation. 
Pain management isn't good enough when a patient can't get more than 9 visits a year. 
If these changes are not made, you're not going to get far with pain meds, opioid or not.

With climate change happening, we will see more and more catastrophic events happening with more and more frequency.

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, species extinction, water usage, water pollution, ocean dead zones, world hunger, and climate change.

Every second of every day, one acre of land is cleared to graze and grow food for all of the ceaseless BILLIONS of animals that are brought into this world for the sole purpose of massacring them at a rate of 2 BILLION land animals per week. With each acre that is cleared, an unimaginable number of birds, mammals, reptiles, plants, and trees are destroyed forever. And, all of the CO2 that those plants and trees were storing is released back into the atmosphere. Not to mention that just in the US alone, livestock produce at least 7 MILLION POUNDS OF MANURE EVERY MINUTE - this is 130 times more excrement than the entire US population of humans produce every minute. The methane produced by livestock is much more hazardous to the environment than the CO2 emitted by all forms of transportation combined.

 The animal agriculture industry is the most brutal and destructive industry that has ever existed. Not only do they ceaselessly kill BILLIONS of helpless cows, pigs, chickens, turkeys, and lambs - they use our tax dollars to kill wild American horses, bears, coyotes, wolves, foxes, lynxes, beavers, bobcats, and non-target endangered animals and people's pets to protect their profits from these animals eating their livestock and competing for grazing land.

 When you consume animal products - you are in fact supporting bestiality, rape, kidnapping, torture, infanticide, and mass murder. If the same exact things that are done to animals - were done to humans - those committing these atrocious acts would be thrown in prison for life - if not given the death penalty.

You see, when you purchase animal-derived products, your money is used to keep the killing system going. Male animals are forced to ejaculate in order for their semen to be collected. That semen is then forced into the vaginas of restrained female animals to impregnate them so that they start producing milk and/or babies. Their babies are fatten up and forced into those ghastly, blood-filled slaughterhouses where their lives are brutally, mercilessly, and needlessly taken from them so animal eaters can feed their addiction to eating corpses of babies of other species. This is what it comes down to - and it's not only unnecessary - IT IS EVIL.

And, if you think eggs are harmless - male chicks are ground up ALIVE by the hundreds of thousands each day in the US alone because they don't lay eggs, don't grow quickly enough to be profitable for meat, and their meat is tough.

There is no nutritional need for humans to consume animals or the things that come out of them. As a matter-of-fact, a healthy vegan diet not only significantly reduces the risk of heart disease (the #1 killer in the US), cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis - it can even cure and/or treat these diseases in those who already have them. An animal-based diet doesn't prevent, treat, or cure any diseases, it causes most of them.

It is complete lunacy to fight against veganism as billions of animals are being needlessly massacred which in turn is killing our planet and causing thousands of people to die each day from preventable diseases.",Lea Korn Derence,2017-10-11 11:01:46,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

==================================
We are witnessing the Second Civil War: The Last Stand of the Evangelical (fake) X-tian White Man, a kind of ""Neo-Confederacy"". The RNC (and their masters, Evangelicals and the NRA) are the AMERICAN TALIBAN.

U.S. demographics are trending towards a non-white majority. Their efforts during this administration will be to secure White (male) control for good.

This means radical changes in voting rules and voter suppression, backed up by crooked courts and military force if necessary. Suppression of the media is also utilized.

The only way to see these aims through and maintain it, is via an Authoritarian/Fascist regime. Here are the earmarks of Fascism:

1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism

2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights

3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause

4. Supremacy of the Military

5. Rampant Sexism

6. Controlled Mass Media

7. Obsession with National Security

8. Religion and Government are Intertwined

9. Corporate Power is Protected

10. Labor Power is Suppressed

11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts

12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment

13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption

14. Fraudulent Elections

15. Claims to Restore Lost National Greatness

16. Restriction of Free Speech

17. Weakening of other branches of government

18. Family members given positions of power.

It’s not like opioids are the only things people become addicted to.  And most people who are prescribed opioids don’t become addicted.

Do you honestly believe that more research is warranted when that information already exists in lord knows how many case studies.

Obama took office in the early stages of a major recession and high unemployment; construction workers out of work everywhere. Taxes were allocated to put people to work, mostly on roads and other infrastructure. Without regard to whether or not those people were organized in unions, and many were not. Built or repaired lots of highways and other infrastructure as part of the stimulus.  Yes, spending was high in the first year, but spending, and the deficit, grew smaller every year.
Trump has added no real wealth, and has taken major actions to destroy the environment, as a hand-out to oil, coal, and other polluting industries. 
Sure the stock market is up, but that's only paper wealth. It does nothing to help the working person, or families.  
I can't believe you list ""Supreme Court Judge"" as a plus. Republicans robbed Obama of his ability to name even a very moderate Justice.  The fact that Trump was allowed to pick a judge,  chosen from a list pre-approved by the religious right, is disgusting, and speaks only to the Republican disregard for the Constitution.",Carla Gunderson,2017-10-10 08:43:30,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We have a Bill of Rights that acknowledges rights we are born with, not granted or created by any government. 

We vote with the knowledge that voting is the most violent act anyone can participate in because voting is electing someone to hire someone to stick a government gun in our neighbors' faces and force our version of reality on them at the threat of their very lives. 

We stand ready to protect our Liberty and the Liberty of our neighbors, not destroy it, via any version of authoritarianism, of any age or place. 

We are prepared with knowledge and force of arms to make war against and kill if necessary those who would destroy our Bill of Rights whether they represent domestic or foreign enemies. 

We do not lie to ourselves, our families, our friends, our business associates, our descendants, our enemies, about these things and do not EVER tolerate those who would have us do so. 

If the troops were fighting for our freedom they'd all be here.

I was diagnosed almost 25yrs ago with a incurable autoimmune type of muscular dystrophy.  For first several years there was minimal and rarely pain, but after several major falls (two landing head first), I ended up in a wheelchair and started having full body muscle pain. Still not extreme, but constant. After about 15 yrs I started on lowest dosage of oxycodone.  It was just enough to ease the constant aching pain thoughout all my muscles. I received a month supply at a time and my dr had to ok a renewal about every 4 months. No problems whatsoever.  Some months would still have a few left. My Dr would periodically talk to me about the effectiveness and realized I did not have addiction tendencies.  When more media coverage began about opiod addiction, my pharmacy suddenly could no longer fill my prescription.  I was just told they couldn't fill it. So, I was without during about a one week period while I processed a change to the new mail order pharmacy affiliated with my medical provider. Actually worked out better for me as it was less expensive also. A new development a couple of years ago when told the more intense pain in joints was osteoarthritis.  Also degenerative T4,5,6 was giving me more problems which was no longer easy to ignore. Anyway, now taking Tramadol instead because even though still on a fairly low dosage and 30 pills at a time, he thought there would no longer be refill problems. There was though,  but not because of the rx itself,  just because the mail order pharmacy screwed up and I went one week without. It was not an easy wait at all. Even though it's a low dossge, still had withdrawal symptoms. My pain was unbearable at times, esp at night when trying to sleep. So, yeah i do get annoyed because i know of others also that require higher dosages and have also had roadblocks to get their usual RX filled.  There is no cure for what I have,  no operation to help  and it's progressive. Right now being ""watched"" by three separate dr's  because blood work and cysts here and there are potentially going to be something else. I truly hope that they figure out how to determine those of us with chronic conditions and not abusing our prescriptions can continue w/o roadblocks.",Nina Stanislaus,2017-10-10 00:27:30,28,23,2,0,0,3,0,0

As for our current situation there is only one fix for it, if it can be fixed. But western so-called men have been de-backboned and de-nutted and shrink from the idea of shedding blood when the tree of Liberty cries out for it in such a plaintive and alarming way.

Welcome to a nation of morons: http://www.freekentucky.com/welcome-to-a-nation-of-morons/

What does 'We the People' actually mean? 

It means we are responsible...

We have a representative republic, guaranteed to every state, not a democracy.

We have a Bill of Rights that acknowledges rights we are born with, not granted or created by any government. 

We vote with the knowledge that voting is the most violent act anyone can participate in because voting is electing someone to hire someone to stick a government gun in our neighbors' faces and force our version of reality on them at the threat of their very lives. 

We stand ready to protect our Liberty and the Liberty of our neighbors, not destroy it, via any version of authoritarianism, of any age or place. 

We are prepared with knowledge and force of arms to make war against and kill if necessary those who would destroy our Bill of Rights whether they represent domestic or foreign enemies. 

We do not lie to ourselves, our families, our friends, our business associates, our descendants, our enemies, about these things and do not EVER tolerate those who would have us do so. 

If the troops were fighting for our freedom they'd all be here.

The 'No Rights that aren't Allowed' group has long been part of the problem. Their leadership and most members are still in deep denial of the realities of this war. 

Another marker in a long slow escalation of our civil war, until they tell us to 'turn them in.' Time to put on the big boy pants.

Attempting reason with communists and many 'conservatives' is akin to slitting one's wrists and jumping into shark infested waters. 

We must make amerika free.

""The whole secret lies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real intent."" - Sun Tzu

Hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting. - Sun Tzu

As for our current situation there is only one fix for it, if it can be fixed. But western so-called men have been de-backboned and de-nutted and shrink from the idea of shedding blood when the tree of Liberty cries out for it in such a plaintive and alarming way.

Welcome to a nation of morons: http://www.freekentucky.com/welcome-to-a-nation-of-morons/

What does 'We the People' actually mean? 

It means we are responsible...

We have a representative republic, guaranteed to every state, not a democracy.

We have a Bill of Rights that acknowledges rights we are born with, not granted or created by any government. 

We vote with the knowledge that voting is the most violent act anyone can participate in because voting is electing someone to hire someone to stick a government gun in our neighbors' faces and force our version of reality on them at the threat of their very lives. 

We stand ready to protect our Liberty and the Liberty of our neighbors, not destroy it, via any version of authoritarianism, of any age or place. 

We are prepared with knowledge and force of arms to make war against and kill if necessary those who would destroy our Bill of Rights whether they represent domestic or foreign enemies. 

We do not lie to ourselves, our families, our friends, our business associates, our descendants, our enemies, about these things and do not EVER tolerate those who would have us do so. 

If the troops were fighting for our freedom they'd all be here.
